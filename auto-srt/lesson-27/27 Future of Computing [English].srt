1
00:00:00,003 --> 00:00:09,003
okay so this is the last lecture for the

2
00:00:03,024 --> 00:00:10,133
class and I'm sure that you've got a lot

3
00:00:09,003 --> 00:00:14,034
of other things going on as well so

4
00:00:10,349 --> 00:00:16,320
thanks for showing up today this is as I

5
00:00:14,034 --> 00:00:18,090
said last time these two lectures are

6
00:00:16,032 --> 00:00:20,049
not part of the course syllabus they're

7
00:00:18,009 --> 00:00:22,298
not on the final exam they're more

8
00:00:20,049 --> 00:00:24,105
looking to the future and in particular

9
00:00:23,189 --> 00:00:27,060
what I want to talk about today is some

10
00:00:25,005 --> 00:00:31,394
kind of studying I did over the past

11
00:00:27,006 --> 00:00:33,063
year about how the electronics industry

12
00:00:31,439 --> 00:00:34,950
what we now call the semiconductor

13
00:00:33,063 --> 00:00:36,902
industry but it might be something

14
00:00:34,095 --> 00:00:41,187
different in the future as new

15
00:00:37,469 --> 00:00:44,910
technology comes along but what what

16
00:00:42,087 --> 00:00:45,506
directions it's going to head and what

17
00:00:44,091 --> 00:00:47,175
we'd be able to assume the kind of

18
00:00:46,289 --> 00:00:51,305
progress that we've come to know and

19
00:00:48,075 --> 00:00:54,314
expect over the past several decades

20
00:00:51,449 --> 00:00:58,170
so in particular and this is important

21
00:00:54,989 --> 00:01:00,570
for obviously for people involved in ECE

22
00:00:58,017 --> 00:01:02,112
but also for people involved in computer

23
00:01:00,057 --> 00:01:07,086
science and software because the fact

24
00:01:03,012 --> 00:01:12,011
that we have this massive collection of

25
00:01:07,086 --> 00:01:14,165
computers data centers powerful cell

26
00:01:12,119 --> 00:01:17,400
phones and things obviously the software

27
00:01:14,939 --> 00:01:19,943
people are important to that but the

28
00:01:17,004 --> 00:01:23,007
reality is it's the hardware base that

29
00:01:19,979 --> 00:01:25,500
makes it possible so it's really an

30
00:01:23,043 --> 00:01:27,135
important thing even for software people

31
00:01:25,005 --> 00:01:31,304
to have a fairly decent understanding of

32
00:01:28,035 --> 00:01:33,914
how the actual systems work what their

33
00:01:31,799 --> 00:01:36,863
technology is and what's it going to

34
00:01:34,229 --> 00:01:40,229
look like in the future so in particular

35
00:01:37,439 --> 00:01:41,820
we've been riding enjoying the benefits

36
00:01:40,229 --> 00:01:46,200
of what's commonly referred to as

37
00:01:41,082 --> 00:01:48,521
Moore's law and Gordon Moore is he still

38
00:01:46,002 --> 00:01:51,031
alive and was one of the earlier

39
00:01:49,259 --> 00:01:54,960
pioneers in the semiconductor industry

40
00:01:51,229 --> 00:01:57,304
he worked for William Shockley who's one

41
00:01:54,096 --> 00:02:00,129
of the inventors of the transistor and

42
00:01:57,979 --> 00:02:03,047
set up there's a company called Shockley

43
00:02:01,029 --> 00:02:07,053
semiconductor that Shockley set up in

44
00:02:03,659 --> 00:02:10,170
the Bay Area in Palo Alto in the late in

45
00:02:07,053 --> 00:02:12,111
the early nineteen know in the 1950s

46
00:02:10,017 --> 00:02:15,081
somewhere and then he

47
00:02:13,011 --> 00:02:18,060
and a group of them left because

48
00:02:15,081 --> 00:02:20,157
Chalkley was such a jerk and found and

49
00:02:18,006 --> 00:02:24,033
found a home at an existing company

50
00:02:21,057 --> 00:02:27,156
called Fairchild that did things like

51
00:02:24,087 --> 00:02:31,101
aviation electronics and set up

52
00:02:28,056 --> 00:02:33,138
Fairchild Semiconductor and so that was

53
00:02:32,001 --> 00:02:37,077
really the start of Silicon Valley from

54
00:02:34,038 --> 00:02:40,367
the silicon perspective actually they're

55
00:02:37,077 --> 00:02:42,090
using germanium at the time but what we

56
00:02:40,709 --> 00:02:49,950
think of a Silicon Valley really got its

57
00:02:42,009 --> 00:02:51,014
start there so he was the the the head

58
00:02:49,095 --> 00:02:54,162
of the research part of Fairchild

59
00:02:52,004 --> 00:02:59,063
Semiconductor when he wrote an article

60
00:02:55,062 --> 00:03:00,144
for a what's really just a trade press

61
00:02:59,459 --> 00:03:04,110
magazine electronics magazine we

62
00:03:01,044 --> 00:03:07,068
wouldn't consider it a very important

63
00:03:04,011 --> 00:03:10,050
publication these days but back then it

64
00:03:07,068 --> 00:03:14,079
had some fairly leading articles and so

65
00:03:10,005 --> 00:03:19,044
he wrote an article and this is in 1965

66
00:03:14,079 --> 00:03:22,143
so almost exactly 50 years ago and what

67
00:03:19,089 --> 00:03:24,186
he done was he just sort of evolved what

68
00:03:23,043 --> 00:03:29,632
his company was able to do in terms of

69
00:03:25,086 --> 00:03:31,113
of building the very new of

70
00:03:30,019 --> 00:03:34,200
semiconductors and it was the very very

71
00:03:32,013 --> 00:03:36,072
early days of integrated circuits when

72
00:03:34,002 --> 00:03:40,071
you could put multiple transistors on a

73
00:03:36,072 --> 00:03:45,072
single chip and what he recognized was

74
00:03:40,089 --> 00:03:48,135
there is sort of a curve of met that on

75
00:03:45,072 --> 00:03:54,078
this axis is how much does it cost to

76
00:03:49,035 --> 00:03:58,394
per transistor to manufacture a system

77
00:03:55,032 --> 00:04:00,108
and on the right hand side how many

78
00:03:58,709 --> 00:04:03,450
transistors there were on a single chip

79
00:04:01,008 --> 00:04:06,035
and what he observed was through sort of

80
00:04:03,045 --> 00:04:08,076
a sweet spot and if you're to the left

81
00:04:06,035 --> 00:04:10,056
you're basically you're not putting

82
00:04:08,076 --> 00:04:13,113
enough things on the chip and so you

83
00:04:10,056 --> 00:04:15,485
have too many chips and they cost a lot

84
00:04:14,013 --> 00:04:18,054
to connect them together and you're not

85
00:04:15,989 --> 00:04:20,250
making use of the technology and if you

86
00:04:18,054 --> 00:04:21,863
go too far to the right then you're

87
00:04:20,025 --> 00:04:23,121
trying to squeeze more on that chip than

88
00:04:22,349 --> 00:04:26,540
it was economically feasible at the time

89
00:04:24,021 --> 00:04:29,024
and what he also observe

90
00:04:26,054 --> 00:04:31,088
was and this is 65 remember so he was

91
00:04:29,024 --> 00:04:34,091
basically projecting from three years

92
00:04:31,088 --> 00:04:37,181
worth of data that that curve was

93
00:04:34,091 --> 00:04:41,156
dropping that and so the sweet spot was

94
00:04:38,081 --> 00:04:43,172
shifting to telling you what's the

95
00:04:42,056 --> 00:04:50,093
optimum number of devices to put on a

96
00:04:44,072 --> 00:04:53,084
single chip from like 20 here 250 there

97
00:04:50,093 --> 00:04:55,109
too and then he projected out and said

98
00:04:53,084 --> 00:04:57,092
well gee by 1970 we should be able to

99
00:04:56,009 --> 00:05:02,018
get a thousand devices on a chip and

100
00:04:58,064 --> 00:05:03,152
that was sort of just a prediction he

101
00:05:02,018 --> 00:05:08,045
made and then that became known as

102
00:05:04,052 --> 00:05:11,063
Moore's law and that name was not made

103
00:05:08,045 --> 00:05:14,114
up by Moore but by actually a professor

104
00:05:11,063 --> 00:05:17,065
at Caltech so what we now know of is

105
00:05:15,014 --> 00:05:19,109
Moore's law was really started with this

106
00:05:17,065 --> 00:05:20,159
prediction and two things are worth

107
00:05:20,009 --> 00:05:24,107
noting one is it's a technology

108
00:05:21,059 --> 00:05:26,120
prediction it's based on what this

109
00:05:25,007 --> 00:05:30,062
company and other companies were able to

110
00:05:27,002 --> 00:05:33,017
do but the other was an economic one it

111
00:05:30,062 --> 00:05:34,133
was saying if you want to make the best

112
00:05:33,035 --> 00:05:38,069
use of this technology and get the most

113
00:05:35,033 --> 00:05:39,041
sort of electronics for your dollar then

114
00:05:38,069 --> 00:05:42,074
you should be following these principles

115
00:05:40,013 --> 00:05:47,018
so and that that combination is actually

116
00:05:42,074 --> 00:05:49,079
quite important so I went off and found

117
00:05:47,018 --> 00:05:52,094
a Wikipedia page that lists a bunch of

118
00:05:50,024 --> 00:05:57,118
different chips for microprocessors and

119
00:05:52,094 --> 00:06:01,115
other types of processors that has the

120
00:05:58,018 --> 00:06:04,109
both the chip area and how many

121
00:06:02,015 --> 00:06:07,016
transistors who were on that and I

122
00:06:05,009 --> 00:06:11,102
mapped it out so it starts the first

123
00:06:07,016 --> 00:06:17,042
microprocessor was called the 4004 made

124
00:06:12,002 --> 00:06:19,079
by Intel in 1971 and up through here you

125
00:06:17,042 --> 00:06:22,070
see that I sort of partitioned these

126
00:06:19,079 --> 00:06:24,086
into different types of processors so a

127
00:06:22,007 --> 00:06:26,048
desktop processor would be like what

128
00:06:24,086 --> 00:06:28,130
you'd have in a PC and they sort of

129
00:06:27,011 --> 00:06:32,039
drove the industry for this middle part

130
00:06:29,003 --> 00:06:33,068
of the time embedded systems are chips

131
00:06:32,039 --> 00:06:35,081
that aren't designed to be computers

132
00:06:33,095 --> 00:06:37,097
that you're using as computers but

133
00:06:35,081 --> 00:06:38,158
they're inside of something for example

134
00:06:37,097 --> 00:06:43,326
the earliest micro problem

135
00:06:39,058 --> 00:06:48,121
the four thousand four was created by

136
00:06:44,199 --> 00:06:51,276
Intel to to run a calculate cop

137
00:06:49,021 --> 00:06:53,880
calculator built by a Japanese company

138
00:06:51,969 --> 00:06:56,830
they came to Intel and said could you

139
00:06:54,069 --> 00:06:59,070
make us some electronics to implement

140
00:06:56,083 --> 00:07:00,088
this and somebody within Intel I had the

141
00:06:59,169 --> 00:07:03,250
inspiration to say well if we just

142
00:07:01,033 --> 00:07:04,102
implement this as a microprocessor then

143
00:07:03,025 --> 00:07:07,036
we can write the code to implement a

144
00:07:05,002 --> 00:07:10,027
desktop calculator and it's what they

145
00:07:07,036 --> 00:07:14,565
call 4-bit microprocessor so you're used

146
00:07:10,027 --> 00:07:16,093
to 32 mentioned four so the word size is

147
00:07:14,889 --> 00:07:18,460
four and how do you do that it's

148
00:07:16,093 --> 00:07:20,922
actually you have to think about how you

149
00:07:18,046 --> 00:07:24,285
even do that but that's what it was a

150
00:07:21,759 --> 00:07:26,778
4-bit microprocessor so anyways embedded

151
00:07:24,699 --> 00:07:30,701
systems sort of some of these were

152
00:07:26,949 --> 00:07:34,240
really a pre PC era and then these

153
00:07:30,719 --> 00:07:37,960
diamonds are ones that sort of drove the

154
00:07:34,024 --> 00:07:41,073
PC era and then the yellow are more

155
00:07:37,096 --> 00:07:42,585
recent graphic processor unit which are

156
00:07:41,289 --> 00:07:46,270
some of the biggest fastest chips out

157
00:07:43,449 --> 00:07:48,460
there the x's are ones that are really

158
00:07:46,027 --> 00:07:51,058
server class machines for example the

159
00:07:48,046 --> 00:07:56,068
shark machines and are designed to be

160
00:07:51,058 --> 00:07:58,105
inside of a big computer room and down

161
00:07:56,068 --> 00:08:01,111
here for example ones are actually for

162
00:07:59,005 --> 00:08:04,494
cell phones but this is just this is not

163
00:08:02,011 --> 00:08:05,074
a scientific sample it's just a one

164
00:08:04,539 --> 00:08:08,607
through which I could find the

165
00:08:05,074 --> 00:08:12,723
appropriate data oh and you might ask

166
00:08:09,219 --> 00:08:17,238
why did you start in 1971 if this paper

167
00:08:13,389 --> 00:08:19,650
came out in 65 well back in 65 the

168
00:08:17,409 --> 00:08:22,360
technology is what they called bipolar

169
00:08:19,065 --> 00:08:26,754
technology which is not a mental

170
00:08:22,036 --> 00:08:27,705
condition here and the it's very

171
00:08:27,339 --> 00:08:31,930
different

172
00:08:28,029 --> 00:08:34,120
so the first microprocessor and all the

173
00:08:31,093 --> 00:08:36,139
successor ones are done in a technology

174
00:08:34,012 --> 00:08:40,050
called MOS which stands for metal oxide

175
00:08:37,039 --> 00:08:44,598
semiconductor which is in a very useful

176
00:08:40,005 --> 00:08:46,087
name but basically chips since the early

177
00:08:44,949 --> 00:08:48,970
seventies have dominantly been using

178
00:08:47,032 --> 00:08:50,551
this technology and the current one is

179
00:08:48,097 --> 00:08:52,526
called CMOS

180
00:08:50,839 --> 00:08:56,490
so anyways the interesting thing you'll

181
00:08:53,399 --> 00:08:58,620
see here is on this log scale you'll see

182
00:08:56,049 --> 00:09:01,058
that this doubling every two years has

183
00:08:58,062 --> 00:09:04,100
almost exactly matched what's happened

184
00:09:02,039 --> 00:09:10,136
so the gray line is if I just

185
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:14,007
extrapolated from from 50 transistors in

186
00:09:11,036 --> 00:09:16,038
1965 and predicted they would double

187
00:09:14,007 --> 00:09:20,022
every two years you get the gray line

188
00:09:16,056 --> 00:09:22,059
and the black line is what I get running

189
00:09:20,022 --> 00:09:24,069
a regression on this data and you'll see

190
00:09:22,086 --> 00:09:26,088
that their scopes are exactly the same

191
00:09:24,069 --> 00:09:28,113
and what that means is the doubling

192
00:09:27,006 --> 00:09:31,095
every two years is absolutely true and

193
00:09:29,013 --> 00:09:33,111
the black line what it says is well

194
00:09:31,095 --> 00:09:35,103
actually they in the early days they got

195
00:09:34,011 --> 00:09:40,020
ahead of the curve somewhat so that the

196
00:09:36,075 --> 00:09:44,127
first microprocessor for example 4004

197
00:09:41,001 --> 00:09:49,019
had around well actually I have the

198
00:09:45,027 --> 00:09:52,346
numbers actually add 1700 transistors so

199
00:09:49,019 --> 00:09:56,858
not too far off of what more addicted

200
00:09:52,589 --> 00:09:59,910
for 1970 so anyways that's the point

201
00:09:57,029 --> 00:10:01,890
it's an amazing thing this is held and

202
00:09:59,091 --> 00:10:05,127
you might ask why was like Gordon Moore

203
00:10:01,089 --> 00:10:07,164
the the best forecaster of the future

204
00:10:06,027 --> 00:10:11,070
ever to be able to nail this number so

205
00:10:08,064 --> 00:10:13,133
precisely and also why do you call it a

206
00:10:11,007 --> 00:10:15,009
law so there's two things going there's

207
00:10:13,709 --> 00:10:18,660
a few things going on here first of all

208
00:10:15,009 --> 00:10:19,101
this is not a law it's not a law of

209
00:10:18,066 --> 00:10:24,081
nature it's not a law of our country

210
00:10:20,082 --> 00:10:29,097
it's not a law of of anything it's just

211
00:10:24,081 --> 00:10:31,173
a statement that he made but also it's

212
00:10:29,097 --> 00:10:33,956
become a self-fulfilling aw meaning that

213
00:10:32,073 --> 00:10:36,075
because Gordon Moore who is a very

214
00:10:34,829 --> 00:10:39,120
prominent person at the time said this

215
00:10:36,075 --> 00:10:40,173
and said his company in that direction

216
00:10:39,012 --> 00:10:47,106
and he then went on to found in tell by

217
00:10:41,073 --> 00:10:50,148
the way he and and all of his colleagues

218
00:10:48,006 --> 00:10:53,061
and his sort of burgeoning business have

219
00:10:51,048 --> 00:10:56,067
just been dedicated to the task of

220
00:10:53,061 --> 00:10:58,107
making this a law so it was a prediction

221
00:10:56,067 --> 00:11:01,126
but not in a sort of objective sense it

222
00:10:59,007 --> 00:11:05,098
was a prediction by somebody who then

223
00:11:02,026 --> 00:11:07,081
motivated other people to fulfill it so

224
00:11:05,098 --> 00:11:09,139
anyways it's pretty interesting that

225
00:11:07,081 --> 00:11:12,085
just collect and if you can collect all

226
00:11:10,039 --> 00:11:16,039
kinds of data and you'll find this this

227
00:11:12,085 --> 00:11:17,122
doubling pretty much holds by the way in

228
00:11:16,039 --> 00:11:20,083
general you should whenever you're

229
00:11:18,022 --> 00:11:21,951
looking at a semi-log pot if you have a

230
00:11:20,083 --> 00:11:26,101
straight line that's a sign of

231
00:11:22,149 --> 00:11:29,200
exponential growth so what does it

232
00:11:27,001 --> 00:11:32,092
really mean then it's hard for you to

233
00:11:29,002 --> 00:11:36,036
appreciate how much different the world

234
00:11:32,092 --> 00:11:39,156
of computing is today than it was even

235
00:11:36,054 --> 00:11:43,057
20 30 40 years ago so for example in

236
00:11:40,056 --> 00:11:44,104
1976 if you had a lot of money in other

237
00:11:43,057 --> 00:11:47,149
words your Los Alamos National

238
00:11:45,004 --> 00:11:51,055
Laboratory and you really wanted a big

239
00:11:48,049 --> 00:11:55,074
computer you could buy it by basically

240
00:11:51,055 --> 00:11:58,464
getting a hand-built machine from a

241
00:11:55,074 --> 00:12:00,079
company called Cray headed by Seymour

242
00:11:58,959 --> 00:12:03,630
Cray who is one of the legendary people

243
00:12:01,024 --> 00:12:06,037
in the world of computing at the time

244
00:12:03,063 --> 00:12:10,212
but this machine is you see all the

245
00:12:06,037 --> 00:12:15,049
numbers for it are way off what even

246
00:12:10,779 --> 00:12:18,040
I've got on my phone and what you have

247
00:12:15,049 --> 00:12:21,097
on your phone to write in terms of

248
00:12:18,004 --> 00:12:25,060
performance in terms of density this

249
00:12:21,097 --> 00:12:29,161
thing weighed 5,000 kilograms and used

250
00:12:25,006 --> 00:12:31,078
115 kilowatts where is now we have these

251
00:12:30,061 --> 00:12:33,124
ones that are powered by batteries and

252
00:12:32,032 --> 00:12:36,118
fit near pockets and the other is

253
00:12:34,024 --> 00:12:38,062
numbers that the whole life of the crane

254
00:12:37,018 --> 00:12:41,104
this was considered an incredibly

255
00:12:38,062 --> 00:12:44,074
successful supercomputer the first real

256
00:12:42,004 --> 00:12:47,673
supercomputer in the whole lifetime they

257
00:12:44,074 --> 00:12:50,733
manufactured 80 of them and as you know

258
00:12:47,709 --> 00:12:54,130
phones sell in the millions so it's

259
00:12:51,399 --> 00:12:58,390
really very very different world we live

260
00:12:54,013 --> 00:13:02,712
in because of of the progress of

261
00:12:58,039 --> 00:13:07,060
integration and so again to put yourself

262
00:13:02,829 --> 00:13:12,370
back back in 65 what I can like I'll

263
00:13:07,006 --> 00:13:13,030
date myself I was a young person at that

264
00:13:12,037 --> 00:13:15,115
time

265
00:13:13,084 --> 00:13:18,142
and for me the coolest thing to get was

266
00:13:16,015 --> 00:13:23,083
a portable transistor radio like this

267
00:13:19,042 --> 00:13:28,066
one that would play AM stations okay now

268
00:13:23,083 --> 00:13:30,118
today what young teenagers crave for is

269
00:13:28,066 --> 00:13:36,103
the sort of waitest consumer product of

270
00:13:31,018 --> 00:13:39,025
a high-end funk so part of it is if you

271
00:13:37,003 --> 00:13:41,092
look at this they even advertise this

272
00:13:39,025 --> 00:13:48,028
transistor radio had nine transistors on

273
00:13:41,092 --> 00:13:54,100
it whereas the chip inside of a this is

274
00:13:48,028 --> 00:13:57,127
last year's the iPhone six had up has if

275
00:13:55,072 --> 00:14:01,156
you still have one a chip with two

276
00:13:58,027 --> 00:14:04,027
billion transistors on it and that's the

277
00:14:02,056 --> 00:14:05,143
main chip there's about eleven chips in

278
00:14:04,027 --> 00:14:09,124
an iPhone in a phone by the way that's

279
00:14:06,043 --> 00:14:12,109
the main processor chip so that's really

280
00:14:10,024 --> 00:14:15,070
the the fundamental difference of why

281
00:14:13,009 --> 00:14:19,011
what you've got today is so different

282
00:14:15,007 --> 00:14:18,048
than what you could get in 65

283
00:14:20,033 --> 00:14:26,036
so it's hard to even think about two

284
00:14:24,011 --> 00:14:28,073
billion transistors and what that really

285
00:14:26,063 --> 00:14:29,162
means so here's an analogy imagine a

286
00:14:28,073 --> 00:14:32,138
transistor where the size of a grain of

287
00:14:30,062 --> 00:14:35,081
sand they're actually a lot smaller than

288
00:14:33,038 --> 00:14:36,134
that but just that's about the smallest

289
00:14:35,081 --> 00:14:38,153
thing you can think of sort of picking

290
00:14:37,034 --> 00:14:42,071
up and feeling then if you look at

291
00:14:39,053 --> 00:14:44,081
here's this original four thousand four

292
00:14:42,071 --> 00:14:45,080
had 2,300 transistors I didn't have my

293
00:14:44,081 --> 00:14:48,110
numbers quite right

294
00:14:45,008 --> 00:14:50,090
so that's if you think in sand grains

295
00:14:49,001 --> 00:14:55,022
it's um actually I calculated this out

296
00:14:51,062 --> 00:14:58,157
it's 170th of a teaspoon so just a very

297
00:14:55,031 --> 00:15:02,117
very small pinch of sand is about 2,300

298
00:14:59,057 --> 00:15:05,111
grains of sand and nowadays if you think

299
00:15:03,017 --> 00:15:09,026
of two billion transistors in in terms

300
00:15:06,011 --> 00:15:13,013
of sand that's about 200 pounds of sand

301
00:15:09,026 --> 00:15:15,029
so if you go to Home Depot and you buy a

302
00:15:13,031 --> 00:15:18,086
bag of sand for your children's for

303
00:15:15,056 --> 00:15:21,125
somebody's a sandbox or whatever it's

304
00:15:18,086 --> 00:15:27,182
about 50 pounds so about four four bags

305
00:15:22,025 --> 00:15:31,094
of sand is 2 billion two billion grains

306
00:15:28,082 --> 00:15:35,177
so that sort of where we are today we're

307
00:15:31,094 --> 00:15:38,128
at sort of a it's the same as if you

308
00:15:36,077 --> 00:15:45,089
filled up big paint bucket three of them

309
00:15:39,028 --> 00:15:48,040
sort of that level we're at so just to

310
00:15:45,089 --> 00:15:50,126
give you a sense where we are and so

311
00:15:48,004 --> 00:15:54,038
what I claim is and this isn't just my

312
00:15:51,026 --> 00:15:58,028
claim it's sort of self-evident that

313
00:15:54,074 --> 00:15:59,150
there's a sort of virtuous cycle that

314
00:15:58,028 --> 00:16:02,084
driven that drives the technology and

315
00:16:00,005 --> 00:16:05,081
the economics together so in particular

316
00:16:02,084 --> 00:16:08,132
the more things they can sell that they

317
00:16:06,026 --> 00:16:11,072
have chips in them the more money that

318
00:16:09,032 --> 00:16:13,076
gives for companies and more incentive

319
00:16:11,072 --> 00:16:14,165
that gives them to invest in research

320
00:16:13,076 --> 00:16:17,141
and development to improve the

321
00:16:15,065 --> 00:16:20,108
technology to buy it's a very expensive

322
00:16:18,041 --> 00:16:23,048
capital equipment to run a semiconductor

323
00:16:21,008 --> 00:16:26,036
fabrication facility and so that money

324
00:16:24,011 --> 00:16:28,064
comes from ultimately because they're

325
00:16:26,036 --> 00:16:30,053
selling this stuff and because of that

326
00:16:28,064 --> 00:16:33,100
they're then able to improve the

327
00:16:30,053 --> 00:16:35,128
technology pack more transistors

328
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:38,095
a chip make them run faster reduce the

329
00:16:36,028 --> 00:16:40,099
power all those good things and then

330
00:16:38,095 --> 00:16:42,106
that's coupled with people who are good

331
00:16:40,099 --> 00:16:44,143
at a product design and of course the

332
00:16:43,006 --> 00:16:48,013
software designers as well to improve

333
00:16:45,043 --> 00:16:51,124
the product so that you want to buy more

334
00:16:48,076 --> 00:16:54,091
stuff right and that causes more sales

335
00:16:52,024 --> 00:16:57,097
so this cycle is very important that if

336
00:16:54,091 --> 00:16:59,106
it weren't for that looping around then

337
00:16:57,097 --> 00:17:01,159
these improvements wouldn't be happening

338
00:17:00,006 --> 00:17:04,105
so right now the semiconductor industry

339
00:17:02,059 --> 00:17:07,548
is worldwide it's very much a

340
00:17:05,005 --> 00:17:09,010
international industry is about 300

341
00:17:08,079 --> 00:17:13,120
billion dollars a year so it's pretty

342
00:17:09,055 --> 00:17:14,149
big and so what does that meant well one

343
00:17:13,012 --> 00:17:18,016
is simply let's just take the example of

344
00:17:15,049 --> 00:17:23,092
phones that the iPhone the first iPhone

345
00:17:18,052 --> 00:17:25,371
was on 2007 or so and there's been nine

346
00:17:23,092 --> 00:17:26,631
generations of them including the most

347
00:17:25,839 --> 00:17:31,780
recent which isn't shown this picture

348
00:17:27,459 --> 00:17:34,180
and so more or less every year they come

349
00:17:31,078 --> 00:17:35,080
out with a new phone and for example

350
00:17:34,018 --> 00:17:39,018
this phone I'm carrying around is one I

351
00:17:35,098 --> 00:17:41,116
bought this fall even though I had a

352
00:17:39,018 --> 00:17:46,087
phone of from two years ago that was

353
00:17:42,016 --> 00:17:48,073
really okay but I was sufficiently

354
00:17:46,087 --> 00:17:50,122
motivated to shell out the money and now

355
00:17:48,073 --> 00:17:54,157
it's not hidden in our plans anymore so

356
00:17:51,022 --> 00:17:59,086
I know this actually cost me $750 but I

357
00:17:55,057 --> 00:18:01,135
and many of my friends and people around

358
00:17:59,086 --> 00:18:04,165
the world did exactly that and created a

359
00:18:02,035 --> 00:18:08,035
huge pile of of cash that infused Apple

360
00:18:05,065 --> 00:18:10,072
and part of the reason Apple now is the

361
00:18:08,035 --> 00:18:14,041
largest company in the world in terms of

362
00:18:10,072 --> 00:18:17,137
market capitalization so that cycle you

363
00:18:14,041 --> 00:18:20,089
can see here you know better products

364
00:18:18,037 --> 00:18:23,041
more sales you you see that happening

365
00:18:20,089 --> 00:18:24,187
all the time but underneath it all

366
00:18:23,041 --> 00:18:29,140
what's driving that then is the ability

367
00:18:25,087 --> 00:18:32,176
to improve these products so you've

368
00:18:30,004 --> 00:18:35,077
probably heard the other kind of stuff

369
00:18:33,076 --> 00:18:38,134
people are talking about is artificial

370
00:18:36,013 --> 00:18:43,069
intelligence and we'll it basically

371
00:18:39,034 --> 00:18:45,046
eliminate all your jobs and the famous

372
00:18:43,069 --> 00:18:46,138
sort of person behind that it's a guy

373
00:18:45,046 --> 00:18:51,094
named Ray Kurzweil

374
00:18:47,038 --> 00:18:54,040
um and so he proposed this idea they

375
00:18:51,094 --> 00:18:53,191
called a singularity which is the the

376
00:18:54,004 --> 00:18:57,013
day

377
00:18:54,091 --> 00:18:59,187
this is I'll just describe it to you can

378
00:18:57,049 --> 00:19:03,103
tell I'm skeptic on this the day that

379
00:19:00,087 --> 00:19:05,176
computers become more powerful than

380
00:19:04,003 --> 00:19:09,007
humans actually that he's not the one

381
00:19:06,076 --> 00:19:11,148
who invented that term then it's all of

382
00:19:09,043 --> 00:19:14,056
a sudden going to create this massive

383
00:19:12,048 --> 00:19:17,095
switchover where the computers are going

384
00:19:14,056 --> 00:19:22,134
to get smarter by teaching themselves to

385
00:19:17,095 --> 00:19:25,096
be smarter and sort off into infinity of

386
00:19:23,034 --> 00:19:28,116
making humans obsolete that's the idea

387
00:19:26,005 --> 00:19:31,099
of the singularity and part of the

388
00:19:29,016 --> 00:19:32,062
argument behind this is basically from

389
00:19:31,099 --> 00:19:34,108
moore's law

390
00:19:32,062 --> 00:19:38,077
so what Crick's well did in this picture

391
00:19:35,089 --> 00:19:40,156
and it actually started with some work

392
00:19:38,077 --> 00:19:45,103
by a person who used to be the robotics

393
00:19:41,056 --> 00:19:48,070
Institute here was he plotted based on

394
00:19:46,003 --> 00:19:50,071
this his measure was calculations per

395
00:19:48,007 --> 00:19:51,103
second per thousand dollars so how much

396
00:19:50,071 --> 00:19:55,128
computation could you buy for a thousand

397
00:19:52,066 --> 00:19:57,163
dollars and he started back in 1900 with

398
00:19:56,028 --> 00:20:01,123
mechanical adding machines and stuff

399
00:19:58,063 --> 00:20:06,067
like that and added these plots you see

400
00:20:02,023 --> 00:20:11,059
this was around 2000 and somehow this is

401
00:20:06,067 --> 00:20:12,130
an article of amazing a potting he

402
00:20:11,059 --> 00:20:15,151
figured that this wasn't even a straight

403
00:20:13,003 --> 00:20:20,074
line it was an upward curve so an upward

404
00:20:16,051 --> 00:20:23,110
curve on a semi-log paper is more than

405
00:20:21,001 --> 00:20:26,020
exponential it's like e to the x squared

406
00:20:24,001 --> 00:20:30,007
or something like that right

407
00:20:26,002 --> 00:20:33,010
so but anyways based on that projection

408
00:20:30,016 --> 00:20:36,085
and based on some notion of the relative

409
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:40,039
power of human versus Mouse versus

410
00:20:36,085 --> 00:20:42,099
insect brains he came out with this

411
00:20:40,039 --> 00:20:44,113
projection that in 2030 roughly

412
00:20:42,099 --> 00:20:48,103
computers would become smarter than

413
00:20:45,013 --> 00:20:51,046
humans and if you just keep that on Kim

414
00:20:49,039 --> 00:20:55,102
eight computers would become smarter

415
00:20:51,046 --> 00:20:58,090
than all humans combined so that we can

416
00:20:56,002 --> 00:21:00,094
talk about this projection and I'm sure

417
00:20:58,009 --> 00:21:03,076
you guys do at times too

418
00:21:00,094 --> 00:21:05,155
but my point of it is this argument it's

419
00:21:04,057 --> 00:21:08,151
fundamentally a Moore's Law argument

420
00:21:06,055 --> 00:21:11,059
right that the argument is basically as

421
00:21:09,051 --> 00:21:14,103
computational power increases because of

422
00:21:11,095 --> 00:21:16,189
this continuing progress of technology

423
00:21:15,003 --> 00:21:19,075
it's inevitable that because humans

424
00:21:17,089 --> 00:21:22,174
aren't really getting smarter much of a

425
00:21:19,075 --> 00:21:24,142
very fast rate that it's inevitable that

426
00:21:23,074 --> 00:21:26,152
computers will become smarter than

427
00:21:25,042 --> 00:21:28,051
humans said Souter the argument but it's

428
00:21:27,052 --> 00:21:30,121
very much based on this assumption that

429
00:21:29,032 --> 00:21:35,076
computer technology is going to continue

430
00:21:31,021 --> 00:21:39,112
to progress at an exponential pace

431
00:21:35,076 --> 00:21:42,088
so let's now imagine and this is

432
00:21:40,012 --> 00:21:44,109
something that you know you could be

433
00:21:42,088 --> 00:21:45,187
thinking about is is what will this mean

434
00:21:45,009 --> 00:21:49,060
50 years from now

435
00:21:46,087 --> 00:21:51,136
so if Moore's law looks back over the

436
00:21:49,006 --> 00:21:54,007
past 50 years now let's look forward for

437
00:21:52,036 --> 00:22:01,045
another 50 years and see what that would

438
00:21:54,007 --> 00:22:04,084
mean and what would possibly be so one

439
00:22:01,045 --> 00:22:06,103
claim I'll make is that whatever is the

440
00:22:05,047 --> 00:22:08,110
most important thing it will be

441
00:22:07,003 --> 00:22:12,052
something that is in the hands of

442
00:22:09,001 --> 00:22:14,095
everyone or is even more ubiquitous than

443
00:22:12,052 --> 00:22:16,081
there are humans on the planet right in

444
00:22:15,004 --> 00:22:18,007
other words that what I claim is the

445
00:22:16,081 --> 00:22:21,109
thing that will be the most important

446
00:22:18,034 --> 00:22:25,126
technology wise will be what's the

447
00:22:22,009 --> 00:22:28,102
largest volume product so I'm not sure

448
00:22:26,026 --> 00:22:31,111
what that will be in 2065 it certainly

449
00:22:29,002 --> 00:22:35,029
will not be called a cell phone it will

450
00:22:32,011 --> 00:22:38,092
look like what we think is a phone after

451
00:22:35,029 --> 00:22:41,041
all of all the things people own cell

452
00:22:38,092 --> 00:22:46,117
phones for what do you use it for the

453
00:22:41,041 --> 00:22:50,047
least making calls right Reese for me so

454
00:22:47,017 --> 00:22:53,023
who knows what it will be but I claim

455
00:22:51,001 --> 00:22:55,012
that and this is a key part of this

456
00:22:53,023 --> 00:22:58,087
argument that I claim it's got to be a

457
00:22:55,012 --> 00:23:01,051
portable low power system so it has to

458
00:22:58,087 --> 00:23:03,106
be powerful computation but has to be

459
00:23:01,051 --> 00:23:05,135
physically small and it can't draw much

460
00:23:04,006 --> 00:23:09,865
power

461
00:23:06,035 --> 00:23:11,036
and that will be and so it might be you

462
00:23:09,919 --> 00:23:13,820
know the Internet of Things where

463
00:23:11,045 --> 00:23:15,053
everything is networked together and

464
00:23:13,082 --> 00:23:18,086
there's computer chips or various chips

465
00:23:16,025 --> 00:23:20,120
and everything that those kind of things

466
00:23:19,022 --> 00:23:25,461
would also have the kind of volumes

467
00:23:21,002 --> 00:23:28,079
needed to drive the market forward so

468
00:23:25,659 --> 00:23:31,070
based on that sort of let's make that

469
00:23:28,097 --> 00:23:32,806
one part of assumption is whatever

470
00:23:31,007 --> 00:23:36,095
drives the future it's going to be

471
00:23:33,679 --> 00:23:39,950
something that is portable low power and

472
00:23:36,095 --> 00:23:41,074
low cost you know consumer grade or

473
00:23:39,095 --> 00:23:43,148
something that you can afford to just

474
00:23:41,929 --> 00:23:46,012
sprinkle across the whole planet or

475
00:23:44,048 --> 00:23:49,070
across the whole galaxy if we're beyond

476
00:23:46,759 --> 00:23:50,788
Earth at that point so that means for

477
00:23:49,007 --> 00:23:52,031
example that it's not going to be a

478
00:23:51,049 --> 00:23:55,072
quantum computer right

479
00:23:52,094 --> 00:23:57,172
quantum cholesterol to make

480
00:23:55,279 --> 00:24:01,190
breakthroughs in superconducting

481
00:23:58,072 --> 00:24:04,381
something that you have to cool down to

482
00:24:01,019 --> 00:24:07,618
near absolute zero requires a big room a

483
00:24:05,029 --> 00:24:11,092
lot of equipment and a lot of power and

484
00:24:07,789 --> 00:24:12,814
a lot of things to manage it so you're

485
00:24:11,659 --> 00:24:16,190
not going to carry that around in your

486
00:24:13,039 --> 00:24:17,116
pocket I can promise you that so all the

487
00:24:16,019 --> 00:24:19,618
people talking about a quantum computer

488
00:24:17,809 --> 00:24:21,811
well we can just rule that out that's

489
00:24:19,789 --> 00:24:29,330
not going to be the the most important

490
00:24:22,009 --> 00:24:30,860
thing out there but it and it also you

491
00:24:29,033 --> 00:24:35,382
know if you could imagine building this

492
00:24:30,086 --> 00:24:36,170
huge machine that occupies many acres of

493
00:24:35,679 --> 00:24:39,350
buildings that's not going to be the

494
00:24:37,007 --> 00:24:41,356
most exciting thing out there because

495
00:24:39,035 --> 00:24:44,224
it's it there's not enough of those to

496
00:24:42,049 --> 00:24:45,145
sort of drive the market and without

497
00:24:44,539 --> 00:24:49,573
that market there won't be in the

498
00:24:46,009 --> 00:24:52,100
investment in the technology so it has

499
00:24:49,879 --> 00:24:53,881
to be inexpensive and what if we think

500
00:24:52,001 --> 00:24:57,053
of it in computer science terms big

501
00:24:53,899 --> 00:24:59,899
o-notation it can't be you know the cost

502
00:24:57,062 --> 00:25:02,063
to produce these things can't be very

503
00:24:59,899 --> 00:25:05,830
much so for example the chip that's in

504
00:25:02,072 --> 00:25:08,511
the cell phone that Apple AAA costs

505
00:25:05,083 --> 00:25:11,782
somewhere between ten and twenty dollars

506
00:25:09,159 --> 00:25:14,750
for Apple to procure that from its

507
00:25:12,529 --> 00:25:18,120
suppliers which are in Taiwan and in

508
00:25:14,075 --> 00:25:20,128
Korea so they're not very expensive

509
00:25:18,012 --> 00:25:23,041
that said it need not be anything based

510
00:25:21,028 --> 00:25:25,051
on the technology we use today as I

511
00:25:23,041 --> 00:25:29,077
mentioned currently things are CMOS and

512
00:25:25,051 --> 00:25:32,580
it's been some kind of moss MOS since

513
00:25:29,077 --> 00:25:34,476
the 1970s so for a long time but

514
00:25:33,039 --> 00:25:36,880
probably won't continue to be that way

515
00:25:35,169 --> 00:25:39,220
at least not in the way we know it and

516
00:25:36,088 --> 00:25:41,637
these various other ideas people have

517
00:25:39,022 --> 00:25:44,091
had for future computer technology that

518
00:25:42,429 --> 00:25:48,340
beyond this and some of it's being

519
00:25:44,289 --> 00:25:51,315
worked on here at CMU and I won't

520
00:25:48,034 --> 00:25:52,983
predict what those could be but they

521
00:25:51,549 --> 00:25:55,870
have to have these characteristics has

522
00:25:53,289 --> 00:26:03,520
to be inexpensive has being low-power

523
00:25:55,087 --> 00:26:04,132
has to be scalable so that's my one

524
00:26:03,052 --> 00:26:06,139
assumption then I'm going to add is

525
00:26:05,032 --> 00:26:09,501
whatever it is we're going to want a lot

526
00:26:07,039 --> 00:26:13,578
of them a lot of transistors or devices

527
00:26:09,789 --> 00:26:16,240
of some sort so what does that mean if

528
00:26:13,929 --> 00:26:18,942
we project that out in terms of how many

529
00:26:16,024 --> 00:26:21,088
devices are on a chip not not how many

530
00:26:19,059 --> 00:26:23,950
transistors four devices so one great

531
00:26:21,088 --> 00:26:25,089
thing about semi-log pots is you can

532
00:26:23,095 --> 00:26:28,096
just extrapolate to your heart's content

533
00:26:25,089 --> 00:26:30,175
so if we just run those two curves that

534
00:26:28,096 --> 00:26:33,145
I showed you before out you get

535
00:26:31,075 --> 00:26:35,874
somewhere we'll just you know pick a

536
00:26:34,045 --> 00:26:38,098
number that sort of roughly in the

537
00:26:36,549 --> 00:26:45,610
middle of those two projections of 10 to

538
00:26:38,098 --> 00:26:48,169
the 17th so 10 to the 17th things

539
00:26:45,061 --> 00:26:52,620
devices in a single integrated system of

540
00:26:49,069 --> 00:26:55,668
some kind and that would be what we'd be

541
00:26:53,169 --> 00:26:58,206
looking at so how big is 10 to the 17th

542
00:26:56,289 --> 00:27:00,730
well if we go back to our sand analogy

543
00:26:58,539 --> 00:27:03,370
this is a picture I found on the

544
00:27:00,073 --> 00:27:05,146
internet of some young man in Brazil on

545
00:27:03,037 --> 00:27:11,226
a beach making a scale model of the

546
00:27:06,046 --> 00:27:15,046
Empire State Building out of sand so my

547
00:27:11,559 --> 00:27:17,980
estimate is this is roughly something

548
00:27:15,046 --> 00:27:19,123
like 3 billion grains of sand in that

549
00:27:17,098 --> 00:27:23,101
thing I didn't count them I have didn't

550
00:27:20,023 --> 00:27:25,120
yet but so so think in terms so

551
00:27:24,001 --> 00:27:28,170
something you know roughly the same

552
00:27:26,002 --> 00:27:29,077
scale I showed you of those 4 bags of

553
00:27:28,179 --> 00:27:31,720
sand from Home Depot something that's

554
00:27:29,095 --> 00:27:33,157
roughly comparable

555
00:27:31,072 --> 00:27:35,140
what we'd get on a chip today if if

556
00:27:34,057 --> 00:27:38,125
transistors were the size of a grain of

557
00:27:36,004 --> 00:27:41,092
sand so what does 10 to the 17th mean

558
00:27:39,025 --> 00:27:44,053
well if you actually built a sand model

559
00:27:42,028 --> 00:27:48,076
of the Empire State Building that

560
00:27:44,053 --> 00:27:51,064
one-to-one scale right then that's a

561
00:27:48,076 --> 00:27:55,078
million cubic meters and then if you

562
00:27:51,064 --> 00:27:56,146
made two replicas of that then and some

563
00:27:55,078 --> 00:28:00,111
of those three together then you'd get

564
00:27:57,046 --> 00:28:03,097
about 10 to the 17th grains of sand so

565
00:28:01,011 --> 00:28:05,053
of course we're assuming this is going

566
00:28:03,097 --> 00:28:06,133
to be something a lot more than a grain

567
00:28:05,053 --> 00:28:09,702
of sand but just to give you a sense of

568
00:28:07,033 --> 00:28:13,111
scale of how big a change that would be

569
00:28:10,179 --> 00:28:16,278
going from a few billion to 10 to the

570
00:28:14,011 --> 00:28:23,095
17th is a pretty big jump in terms of

571
00:28:17,169 --> 00:28:26,260
how many devices are involved so let's

572
00:28:23,095 --> 00:28:28,132
figure out how could we make things you

573
00:28:26,026 --> 00:28:31,120
know let's just say well let's just try

574
00:28:29,032 --> 00:28:33,094
running the numbers and seeing what

575
00:28:32,002 --> 00:28:35,101
would happen if we just took our current

576
00:28:33,094 --> 00:28:38,170
technology which is more or less what

577
00:28:36,019 --> 00:28:41,097
we've been using since 1970 of putting a

578
00:28:39,007 --> 00:28:44,014
lot of transistors on a single chip

579
00:28:41,097 --> 00:28:50,046
actually I happen to bring some toys

580
00:28:44,077 --> 00:28:53,089
with me today this is a wafer so this is

581
00:28:50,919 --> 00:28:57,390
what comes through a fabrication plant

582
00:28:53,089 --> 00:28:59,113
and it's got typically about 700

583
00:28:57,039 --> 00:29:02,137
individuals whether they called I on

584
00:29:00,013 --> 00:29:04,102
them but then they slice up and they put

585
00:29:03,037 --> 00:29:08,346
in packages so these are some old

586
00:29:05,002 --> 00:29:10,096
packages but now on your phone or your

587
00:29:08,679 --> 00:29:14,970
laptops whose packaging in there so they

588
00:29:10,096 --> 00:29:16,162
package the the chips inside of there so

589
00:29:14,097 --> 00:29:20,170
typically then this is the current size

590
00:29:17,062 --> 00:29:23,871
that a company manufactures a diet at 30

591
00:29:21,007 --> 00:29:28,072
centimeters so about 1 foot in diameter

592
00:29:24,429 --> 00:29:31,440
and you get about 700 chips on it to

593
00:29:29,035 --> 00:29:35,035
typically around one square centimeter

594
00:29:31,539 --> 00:29:38,320
so let's just say well let's just take

595
00:29:35,035 --> 00:29:41,089
that technology which over the years

596
00:29:38,032 --> 00:29:44,053
these these die of these chips have

597
00:29:41,089 --> 00:29:44,358
gotten the wafers have gotten bigger the

598
00:29:44,053 --> 00:29:46,872
die

599
00:29:45,159 --> 00:29:49,161
gotten a little bit bigger and we've

600
00:29:47,349 --> 00:29:53,200
also been able to make much finer

601
00:29:49,179 --> 00:29:56,187
geometries on these chips so let's sort

602
00:29:53,002 --> 00:29:58,581
of see how we've got this over history

603
00:29:56,979 --> 00:30:03,987
and what the projections of that would

604
00:29:58,779 --> 00:30:05,793
mean and what the data show is that the

605
00:30:04,059 --> 00:30:09,460
way we've achieved is sort of doubling

606
00:30:05,919 --> 00:30:11,004
every two years in how many transistors

607
00:30:09,046 --> 00:30:13,355
were on a chip is one the trips have

608
00:30:11,769 --> 00:30:16,857
gotten bigger they've doubled in size

609
00:30:13,769 --> 00:30:18,828
the rate of once every ten years and

610
00:30:17,649 --> 00:30:22,701
also the geometries have gotten finer

611
00:30:19,359 --> 00:30:25,404
that we've they've doubled in size or

612
00:30:23,169 --> 00:30:29,202
halved in size where the density we can

613
00:30:25,809 --> 00:30:33,870
get as a result has gone by a factor to

614
00:30:29,499 --> 00:30:35,550
every about four times in ten years and

615
00:30:34,419 --> 00:30:38,590
so you sum those up you get five

616
00:30:36,009 --> 00:30:43,050
doublings every ten years and that's how

617
00:30:38,059 --> 00:30:46,248
you get Moore's law so in particular if

618
00:30:43,419 --> 00:30:48,480
you look at the earliest chip the four

619
00:30:46,779 --> 00:30:51,190
thousand four was about twelve square

620
00:30:49,029 --> 00:30:55,065
millimeters so that it's pretty small

621
00:30:51,019 --> 00:30:58,758
and a modern chip is typically around a

622
00:30:55,389 --> 00:31:03,453
square centimeter so and this is

623
00:30:58,929 --> 00:31:05,937
actually to scale to a dime there are

624
00:31:04,029 --> 00:31:07,092
some bigger chips out there and they're

625
00:31:06,009 --> 00:31:11,440
not really blue they just did this to

626
00:31:07,659 --> 00:31:14,747
make it look nice but IBM for example

627
00:31:11,044 --> 00:31:19,493
makes a server where the chip size is

628
00:31:15,539 --> 00:31:21,615
almost ten times larger than than this

629
00:31:19,889 --> 00:31:25,330
processor so you can get some pretty big

630
00:31:22,299 --> 00:31:28,210
dye out there but those are typically

631
00:31:25,033 --> 00:31:30,046
only and also some GPUs can be pretty

632
00:31:28,021 --> 00:31:32,044
big dot so those are used either in

633
00:31:30,046 --> 00:31:34,815
servers or in places where they're

634
00:31:32,044 --> 00:31:36,109
pretty specialized for more portable

635
00:31:35,229 --> 00:31:41,298
battery-powered things you have to go

636
00:31:37,009 --> 00:31:44,898
with smaller chips so this is the data

637
00:31:41,919 --> 00:31:46,980
showing the area for these different

638
00:31:44,979 --> 00:31:49,210
micro processors for time and you can

639
00:31:47,529 --> 00:31:52,538
see that you're kind of all over the map

640
00:31:49,021 --> 00:31:55,320
so it's a little risky to do any kind of

641
00:31:52,619 --> 00:31:57,642
extrapolation here but this is where I

642
00:31:55,509 --> 00:31:58,710
got the number that it's doubled roughly

643
00:31:57,849 --> 00:32:03,010
every ten

644
00:31:58,071 --> 00:32:05,145
the area of the chip so if we project

645
00:32:03,001 --> 00:32:09,082
that out then then we get something of

646
00:32:06,045 --> 00:32:10,138
173 square centimeters so those of you

647
00:32:09,082 --> 00:32:12,135
metrically challenge that number

648
00:32:11,038 --> 00:32:16,042
probably doesn't mean much to you but

649
00:32:13,035 --> 00:32:20,050
just to give you a sense like if I just

650
00:32:16,042 --> 00:32:24,048
extrapolated then by the Year 2065 I

651
00:32:20,005 --> 00:32:30,097
should be up to the Apple model a 59

652
00:32:25,002 --> 00:32:34,024
because right today's a 6s and so

653
00:32:31,042 --> 00:32:36,130
anyways and it will as we said 10 to the

654
00:32:34,024 --> 00:32:39,079
17 transistors that will be 173 square

655
00:32:37,003 --> 00:32:41,098
centimeters the problem with that is

656
00:32:39,079 --> 00:32:45,094
it's actually bigger than a dollar bill

657
00:32:42,025 --> 00:32:47,098
it's about two dollar bills in size 173

658
00:32:45,094 --> 00:32:49,101
square centimeters and you're not going

659
00:32:47,098 --> 00:32:51,177
to fit that in your pocket

660
00:32:50,001 --> 00:32:55,045
notice you have really big pocket so

661
00:32:52,077 --> 00:32:57,124
that is not the way things are going to

662
00:32:55,045 --> 00:32:59,136
work we can't just keep scaling up area

663
00:32:58,024 --> 00:33:03,040
and expect that to happen

664
00:33:00,036 --> 00:33:05,038
well the other factor which is we showed

665
00:33:03,004 --> 00:33:08,020
is more critical as things have gotten

666
00:33:05,056 --> 00:33:11,070
smaller and so the way I'll I'll measure

667
00:33:08,056 --> 00:33:15,145
that is I'll take this measure I call L

668
00:33:11,007 --> 00:33:19,048
the linear metric of of chip density

669
00:33:16,045 --> 00:33:22,057
I'll say the area of that chip divided

670
00:33:20,011 --> 00:33:23,095
by the number of transistors and so one

671
00:33:22,057 --> 00:33:25,093
way to think about it is if the

672
00:33:23,095 --> 00:33:28,192
transistors are spread in a sort of

673
00:33:25,093 --> 00:33:31,156
uniform grid across a chip then their

674
00:33:29,092 --> 00:33:33,169
spacing would be this number L of course

675
00:33:32,056 --> 00:33:35,131
they're not there they're denser in some

676
00:33:34,069 --> 00:33:37,084
places and more spread out and others

677
00:33:36,031 --> 00:33:40,087
but sort of if you think of this as a

678
00:33:37,084 --> 00:33:44,128
way to look overall how close we packed

679
00:33:40,087 --> 00:33:48,112
our transistors to each other and this

680
00:33:45,028 --> 00:33:50,116
is the curve you get from our existing

681
00:33:49,012 --> 00:33:53,031
set of processors and you see this one

682
00:33:51,016 --> 00:33:55,114
really is a pretty strong trend of

683
00:33:53,031 --> 00:33:58,065
getting a finer and finer geometries

684
00:33:56,014 --> 00:33:58,065
over time

685
00:34:00,219 --> 00:34:08,690
and it's so the linear scale it drops by

686
00:34:04,058 --> 00:34:11,407
a factor of two every five years but if

687
00:34:08,069 --> 00:34:14,998
you think about the number of things the

688
00:34:11,929 --> 00:34:21,520
density therefore goes by a factor of

689
00:34:15,619 --> 00:34:22,714
four every five years and so that or

690
00:34:21,052 --> 00:34:26,371
equivalently I've gotten twice as many

691
00:34:23,569 --> 00:34:29,440
transistors in a given area every two

692
00:34:26,839 --> 00:34:29,440
and a half years

693
00:34:32,069 --> 00:34:39,478
and we can see that again in practice

694
00:34:34,909 --> 00:34:45,220
that if you measure out for the Intel

695
00:34:40,099 --> 00:34:48,100
4004 it comes out to 72,000 nanometers

696
00:34:45,022 --> 00:34:52,028
10 to the ninth meters is this measure

697
00:34:48,109 --> 00:34:54,800
and where's EPEL a 8 is 211 nanometers

698
00:34:52,028 --> 00:34:57,074
so those you know about chip technology

699
00:34:54,008 --> 00:35:02,009
might know that the AAA was manufactured

700
00:34:57,074 --> 00:35:06,092
with what's called a 22 nanometer

701
00:35:02,009 --> 00:35:08,084
process so when they measure when you

702
00:35:06,092 --> 00:35:10,175
hear people talking about a process you

703
00:35:09,065 --> 00:35:13,079
know the actual fabrication process and

704
00:35:11,075 --> 00:35:15,097
they give a number of nowadays and

705
00:35:13,079 --> 00:35:17,153
nanometers what I mean it's a sort of

706
00:35:15,097 --> 00:35:20,122
closest spacing you can make two wires

707
00:35:18,053 --> 00:35:24,112
on a chip sort of finest geometry there

708
00:35:21,022 --> 00:35:27,050
but this measure L is bigger because it

709
00:35:24,589 --> 00:35:30,260
accounts for not just out what you how

710
00:35:27,005 --> 00:35:32,018
closely you can pack wires but all the

711
00:35:30,026 --> 00:35:34,375
other stuff you have to put transistors

712
00:35:32,063 --> 00:35:36,098
there you have to route power and ground

713
00:35:34,609 --> 00:35:38,632
and signal wires to them and they have

714
00:35:36,098 --> 00:35:39,191
to be isolated from each other so this

715
00:35:38,839 --> 00:35:46,160
is actually a more useful measure of of

716
00:35:40,091 --> 00:35:48,125
the effect of spacing on a chip um so

717
00:35:46,016 --> 00:35:51,095
just to again if you're not so familiar

718
00:35:49,025 --> 00:35:55,073
with this kind of geometry let's just

719
00:35:51,095 --> 00:35:59,147
give you some idea of it so this range

720
00:35:55,073 --> 00:36:02,212
in nanometers then between a thousand

721
00:36:00,047 --> 00:36:04,118
and a million then is sort of something

722
00:36:02,869 --> 00:36:08,240
smaller than a millimeter right a

723
00:36:05,018 --> 00:36:10,073
million nanometers is a millimeter so a

724
00:36:08,024 --> 00:36:14,045
thousand nanometers is a micron or a

725
00:36:10,073 --> 00:36:16,142
micrometer and so this range which is

726
00:36:14,045 --> 00:36:21,116
where some any conductor processing was

727
00:36:17,042 --> 00:36:24,074
up till ten years ago you'd call it the

728
00:36:22,016 --> 00:36:28,195
submillimetre range and in this it's in

729
00:36:24,074 --> 00:36:30,076
the sub micrometer range so just to give

730
00:36:28,339 --> 00:36:33,200
you some sense of what those scales mean

731
00:36:30,076 --> 00:36:34,115
and I'll point out that it's pretty

732
00:36:33,002 --> 00:36:38,024
incredible to talk about something over

733
00:36:35,015 --> 00:36:40,474
six orders of magnitude in scale right

734
00:36:38,042 --> 00:36:42,090
that's in the physical world six orders

735
00:36:40,609 --> 00:36:45,240
of magnitude is a law

736
00:36:42,009 --> 00:36:47,034
so again if you look at here's some

737
00:36:45,024 --> 00:36:52,089
examples of things of how big is a

738
00:36:48,015 --> 00:36:56,414
micrometer often called a micron so you

739
00:36:52,089 --> 00:36:59,148
know things that the are almost visible

740
00:36:56,549 --> 00:37:05,670
at this scale a human cell how thick a

741
00:37:00,048 --> 00:37:10,607
piece of plastic saran wrap is how thick

742
00:37:05,067 --> 00:37:13,143
a a strand of spider silk is gives you

743
00:37:11,039 --> 00:37:16,970
some rough number and so this Intel chip

744
00:37:14,043 --> 00:37:21,048
from the seventies was somewhere in that

745
00:37:16,097 --> 00:37:24,116
range and now if we look somewhere

746
00:37:21,093 --> 00:37:28,098
between a nanometer and a mic micrometer

747
00:37:25,016 --> 00:37:31,113
and again this is a log pot or so these

748
00:37:28,098 --> 00:37:34,152
things go pretty fast so for example all

749
00:37:32,013 --> 00:37:39,932
a visible light is in this range between

750
00:37:35,052 --> 00:37:41,621
400 and 700 nanometers and the spacing

751
00:37:40,049 --> 00:37:44,640
of transistors on an Apple chip are

752
00:37:42,089 --> 00:37:48,089
therefore closer than then the

753
00:37:44,064 --> 00:37:49,493
wavelength of visible light by the way

754
00:37:48,089 --> 00:37:54,092
which makes for kind of a challenge for

755
00:37:50,069 --> 00:37:56,123
manufacturing something like how thick

756
00:37:54,119 --> 00:37:59,213
is a cell membrane or how what's the

757
00:37:56,609 --> 00:38:02,970
diameter of a strand of DNA are down in

758
00:38:00,059 --> 00:38:05,250
just a few nanometer range what they

759
00:38:02,097 --> 00:38:07,196
call carbon Namek nanotubes which people

760
00:38:05,025 --> 00:38:10,026
predict will be possibly a successor to

761
00:38:08,069 --> 00:38:14,730
transistors their diameter not their

762
00:38:10,026 --> 00:38:16,835
length is one nanometer so those are

763
00:38:14,073 --> 00:38:20,192
pretty small when you're getting down

764
00:38:17,069 --> 00:38:22,650
here and nowadays modern processes

765
00:38:20,849 --> 00:38:26,896
they're trying to create features down

766
00:38:22,065 --> 00:38:30,944
in this range of 14 nanometers example

767
00:38:27,319 --> 00:38:34,950
okay but we can do our plot and if you

768
00:38:31,529 --> 00:38:39,690
just project out you'll get down to this

769
00:38:34,095 --> 00:38:41,142
linear spacing of 230 Pico meters in 50

770
00:38:39,069 --> 00:38:42,988
years so what does that mean how big is

771
00:38:42,042 --> 00:38:46,044
a Pico meter

772
00:38:43,609 --> 00:38:48,510
well Pico meter is really small in fact

773
00:38:46,044 --> 00:38:54,069
if you look at the spacing between two

774
00:38:48,051 --> 00:38:56,067
atoms in a silicon crystal they're about

775
00:38:54,069 --> 00:38:58,074
half of a nanometer

776
00:38:56,067 --> 00:39:02,072
and if you look at the spacing between

777
00:38:59,019 --> 00:39:07,074
the two atoms in a hydrogen molecule

778
00:39:02,072 --> 00:39:09,096
there are 74 picometers so what the main

779
00:39:07,074 --> 00:39:11,142
thing to realize is this ain't going to

780
00:39:09,096 --> 00:39:13,167
happen there is absolutely no way that

781
00:39:12,042 --> 00:39:17,951
we'll be able to create systems where

782
00:39:14,067 --> 00:39:20,091
things are spaced only 230 Miko meters

783
00:39:18,329 --> 00:39:22,650
apart right because presumably whatever

784
00:39:20,091 --> 00:39:27,144
we build is going to be bigger than a

785
00:39:22,065 --> 00:39:32,163
hydrogen atom or molecule so or you know

786
00:39:28,044 --> 00:39:35,049
so this really is not in the range of

787
00:39:33,063 --> 00:39:37,101
physically possible and that's one of

788
00:39:35,049 --> 00:39:39,878
the annoying things that physics has

789
00:39:38,001 --> 00:39:45,080
sort of gotten in the way of progress

790
00:39:40,319 --> 00:39:48,660
recently so in particular you know could

791
00:39:45,089 --> 00:39:51,720
we imagine then let's just suppose we'll

792
00:39:48,066 --> 00:39:54,119
allow a chip we'll say let's go to chip

793
00:39:51,072 --> 00:39:58,074
be as big as 400 square millimetres just

794
00:39:55,019 --> 00:40:02,138
about twice as big on a side as the

795
00:39:58,074 --> 00:40:04,146
current chip current standard chip that

796
00:40:02,309 --> 00:40:11,660
would still require this spacing metric

797
00:40:05,046 --> 00:40:12,665
of 63 Pico meters in this isn't right

798
00:40:11,066 --> 00:40:15,075
yeah

799
00:40:13,079 --> 00:40:17,420
because I'm not allowed to make chips to

800
00:40:15,075 --> 00:40:21,150
the size of $2 bills

801
00:40:17,042 --> 00:40:26,681
so it requires even finer spacing here

802
00:40:22,005 --> 00:40:29,774
and we saw that's just 63 Pico meters is

803
00:40:27,059 --> 00:40:32,108
actually closer than the two atoms in a

804
00:40:30,269 --> 00:40:35,272
hydrogen molecule the two nuclei in a

805
00:40:32,549 --> 00:40:35,551
hydrogen molecule

806
00:40:35,074 --> 00:40:40,092
so the answer is no this isn't going to

807
00:40:38,589 --> 00:40:44,170
happen this just playing is not possible

808
00:40:40,092 --> 00:40:45,139
at least not you know so we have to back

809
00:40:44,017 --> 00:40:48,019
off and say well what's our defect our

810
00:40:46,039 --> 00:40:49,039
thinking one is to assume that we're

811
00:40:48,019 --> 00:40:53,020
going to just take this current

812
00:40:49,039 --> 00:40:57,088
technology of two-dimensional things and

813
00:40:53,002 --> 00:40:59,011
just shrink it and one reason we look at

814
00:40:57,088 --> 00:41:02,119
that way because that's exactly what's

815
00:40:59,029 --> 00:41:04,848
happened over the past 50 years but we

816
00:41:03,019 --> 00:41:08,038
have three dimensions in this world and

817
00:41:05,109 --> 00:41:11,950
so maybe there's some prospect there so

818
00:41:08,038 --> 00:41:16,039
let's say instead okay let's imagine a

819
00:41:11,095 --> 00:41:17,164
little brick of stuff and I'll just make

820
00:41:16,048 --> 00:41:20,140
up some numbers I'll say 2 centimeters

821
00:41:18,064 --> 00:41:24,100
on a side and 5 millimeters high it's

822
00:41:21,004 --> 00:41:30,723
almost exactly the same shape and volume

823
00:41:25,000 --> 00:41:34,099
as a stack of five nickels and so and

824
00:41:31,119 --> 00:41:37,570
now let's just imagine okay how are we

825
00:41:34,099 --> 00:41:38,125
going to integrate a bunch of things

826
00:41:37,057 --> 00:41:42,139
well presumably we're going to build it

827
00:41:39,025 --> 00:41:45,106
out of layers and so let's just assume

828
00:41:43,039 --> 00:41:48,498
that there's about a hundred thousand

829
00:41:46,006 --> 00:41:50,805
layers worth of stuff and those are what

830
00:41:48,849 --> 00:41:55,660
I'll call logical layers meaning that

831
00:41:50,859 --> 00:41:58,330
they'll be about a million physical

832
00:41:55,066 --> 00:42:00,088
layers because we have to have wires and

833
00:41:58,033 --> 00:42:03,130
these whatever we're building will be

834
00:42:00,088 --> 00:42:09,096
just these totally flat things nowadays

835
00:42:04,003 --> 00:42:16,045
there's a modern chip has more like 20

836
00:42:09,096 --> 00:42:17,101
physical layers on it so but the point

837
00:42:16,072 --> 00:42:19,108
is that we'll have to have about a

838
00:42:18,001 --> 00:42:23,090
million physical layers worth of stuff

839
00:42:20,008 --> 00:42:26,103
to get a hundred thousand logical layers

840
00:42:23,099 --> 00:42:31,300
but that would allow us a spacing on the

841
00:42:27,003 --> 00:42:34,081
linear spacing of about 20 nanometers so

842
00:42:31,003 --> 00:42:38,068
20 nanometers is a lot better than a 63

843
00:42:34,081 --> 00:42:42,175
picometers right if we go back 20

844
00:42:38,095 --> 00:42:45,190
nanometers is up in here so it's really

845
00:42:43,075 --> 00:42:49,093
really small but it's not

846
00:42:46,009 --> 00:42:51,025
it's not beyond a physical possibility

847
00:42:49,093 --> 00:42:53,167
which is put it that way so you could

848
00:42:52,006 --> 00:42:57,088
imagine some technology that would give

849
00:42:54,067 --> 00:43:01,108
you that so at least at some level it

850
00:42:57,088 --> 00:43:06,115
it's vaguely you know it's aggressive

851
00:43:02,008 --> 00:43:10,066
but but possible to imagine in 50 years

852
00:43:07,015 --> 00:43:13,030
be able to manufacture in a shape like

853
00:43:10,066 --> 00:43:18,097
that something with 10 to the 17th

854
00:43:13,003 --> 00:43:21,070
devices but there's a few problems one

855
00:43:18,097 --> 00:43:22,149
is actually the manufacturing how we do

856
00:43:21,097 --> 00:43:25,102
actually do this is no small thing

857
00:43:23,049 --> 00:43:28,051
another I'll talk about some is how do

858
00:43:26,002 --> 00:43:30,028
we do this and not spend a whole lot and

859
00:43:28,051 --> 00:43:32,098
exorbitant amount of money doing it and

860
00:43:30,028 --> 00:43:35,091
the other is a huge huge problem of

861
00:43:32,098 --> 00:43:38,155
power consumption how can we actually

862
00:43:35,091 --> 00:43:41,092
have a system that complicated and keep

863
00:43:39,055 --> 00:43:44,074
it at the limited energy level we have

864
00:43:41,092 --> 00:43:47,098
available so let me go into that some

865
00:43:44,074 --> 00:43:49,111
more so just is a sort of tutorial the

866
00:43:47,098 --> 00:43:51,130
way these chips are made and part of the

867
00:43:50,011 --> 00:43:56,014
reason they're so cheap is it's sort of

868
00:43:52,003 --> 00:44:00,049
a photo process meaning that every step

869
00:43:56,041 --> 00:44:03,043
of the way is done by putting a some

870
00:44:00,076 --> 00:44:08,083
kind of material down and exposing it to

871
00:44:03,043 --> 00:44:09,109
a light a laser light and then that this

872
00:44:08,083 --> 00:44:12,139
material that you've put down is

873
00:44:10,009 --> 00:44:15,028
light-sensitive and so there's a mask

874
00:44:13,039 --> 00:44:18,073
that defines how things should be

875
00:44:15,028 --> 00:44:21,046
patterned and the white only hits where

876
00:44:18,073 --> 00:44:23,107
the mask is allows it to and that's how

877
00:44:21,046 --> 00:44:26,065
you get different shapes and things and

878
00:44:24,007 --> 00:44:28,096
you can either add material or you can

879
00:44:26,065 --> 00:44:30,157
remove material by these masking steps

880
00:44:28,096 --> 00:44:34,177
so nowadays the modern chip takes about

881
00:44:31,057 --> 00:44:37,066
60 of these steps we're involving a mask

882
00:44:35,077 --> 00:44:39,145
and some type of either depositing

883
00:44:38,047 --> 00:44:44,050
something or removing something or

884
00:44:40,045 --> 00:44:48,064
shining light on it or a beam of ions or

885
00:44:44,005 --> 00:44:50,103
some other process step to do it so it's

886
00:44:48,064 --> 00:44:53,068
very complicated than the technology is

887
00:44:51,048 --> 00:44:59,050
quite remarkable but what you could say

888
00:44:54,004 --> 00:45:00,080
is that the even though there's a couple

889
00:44:59,068 --> 00:45:03,092
billion transit

890
00:45:00,008 --> 00:45:05,033
she's on a chip it still is a constant

891
00:45:03,092 --> 00:45:08,153
time process some fixed number of steps

892
00:45:06,005 --> 00:45:12,020
and it's done and Beach successive

893
00:45:09,053 --> 00:45:13,094
generation maybe the number of masking

894
00:45:12,002 --> 00:45:16,060
steps has increased a little bit over

895
00:45:13,094 --> 00:45:20,096
time but roughly speaking it's always a

896
00:45:16,078 --> 00:45:23,159
constant time operation and it turns out

897
00:45:21,014 --> 00:45:26,069
that the bottleneck in this and the

898
00:45:24,059 --> 00:45:30,101
performance one is actually this

899
00:45:26,069 --> 00:45:34,115
photolithography exposing the chip the

900
00:45:31,001 --> 00:45:37,088
the wafer using a mask and the way

901
00:45:35,015 --> 00:45:41,066
that's done nowadays is a machine called

902
00:45:37,088 --> 00:45:44,147
a stepper that basically is used to scan

903
00:45:41,066 --> 00:45:48,158
over the wafer and expose with a laser

904
00:45:45,047 --> 00:45:54,065
sort of flashing as it goes to expose

905
00:45:49,058 --> 00:46:00,073
the wafer to this mask and so current

906
00:45:54,065 --> 00:46:00,073
day that's done it up on a size of about

907
00:46:01,084 --> 00:46:05,120
eight hundred nine hundred square

908
00:46:04,004 --> 00:46:09,092
millimeters so you know about this

909
00:46:06,002 --> 00:46:12,095
bigger size how much they can expose at

910
00:46:10,028 --> 00:46:14,081
a time and the fastest steppers out

911
00:46:13,013 --> 00:46:17,027
there can do a whole way for in eighteen

912
00:46:14,081 --> 00:46:20,137
seconds which is pretty good if you

913
00:46:17,027 --> 00:46:23,102
think of waving over this whole area

914
00:46:21,037 --> 00:46:27,068
flashing and exposing it with extremely

915
00:46:24,002 --> 00:46:32,081
high resolution and very high alignment

916
00:46:27,068 --> 00:46:34,145
of reliability so but that's sort of the

917
00:46:32,081 --> 00:46:37,106
thing that sort of limits how many chips

918
00:46:35,045 --> 00:46:41,069
you can run through a fabrication

919
00:46:38,006 --> 00:46:43,028
facility per day is this stepper and the

920
00:46:41,069 --> 00:46:45,137
stepper is the most expensive piece of

921
00:46:43,028 --> 00:46:48,059
machinery in the building so you don't

922
00:46:46,037 --> 00:46:50,116
want to buy a whole lot of them so

923
00:46:48,059 --> 00:46:53,072
that's sort of my point is that

924
00:46:51,016 --> 00:46:55,088
lithography is the expensive thing so

925
00:46:53,072 --> 00:46:57,097
every layer we have to do if we have to

926
00:46:55,088 --> 00:47:01,121
expose it using this technique is

927
00:46:57,097 --> 00:47:04,196
expensive and so there's no way you

928
00:47:02,021 --> 00:47:08,048
could do a million layer system using

929
00:47:05,096 --> 00:47:10,187
photo lithography and keep the expense

930
00:47:08,048 --> 00:47:13,064
down to the range where it would be

931
00:47:11,087 --> 00:47:13,151
something you or I would would be able

932
00:47:13,064 --> 00:47:16,136
to afford

933
00:47:14,051 --> 00:47:18,107
as a consumer device as I said a modern

934
00:47:17,036 --> 00:47:21,104
chip is somewhere between 10 and 20

935
00:47:19,007 --> 00:47:25,016
dollars so we're not talking a lot of

936
00:47:22,004 --> 00:47:28,049
money like well if you increase that

937
00:47:25,097 --> 00:47:29,102
cost by a hundred then people aren't

938
00:47:28,049 --> 00:47:32,090
going to buy it because if you think

939
00:47:30,002 --> 00:47:37,024
it's a ten dollar chip powers at $700

940
00:47:32,009 --> 00:47:39,020
phone then of these big multiplier there

941
00:47:37,024 --> 00:47:41,102
so there's various options you can

942
00:47:40,001 --> 00:47:44,075
imagine one is what they call chemical

943
00:47:42,002 --> 00:47:48,014
self-assembly where basically whatever

944
00:47:44,075 --> 00:47:50,153
you're having sort of patterns itself

945
00:47:48,014 --> 00:47:53,099
just like the crystals would in a you

946
00:47:51,053 --> 00:47:55,112
know in a block of or something like

947
00:47:53,099 --> 00:47:57,176
that if you can imagine various chemical

948
00:47:56,012 --> 00:48:01,043
processes where things just form into

949
00:47:58,076 --> 00:48:04,076
the particulars aped so this is an area

950
00:48:01,043 --> 00:48:06,089
that's been tried and worked on for

951
00:48:04,076 --> 00:48:07,169
electronics for several decades and

952
00:48:06,089 --> 00:48:11,108
never really succeeded yet but maybe

953
00:48:08,069 --> 00:48:16,108
that's possible and another possibility

954
00:48:12,008 --> 00:48:20,009
would be some interesting ideas in in

955
00:48:17,008 --> 00:48:25,019
multiple working with multiple layers at

956
00:48:20,009 --> 00:48:26,090
once so in particular one technology

957
00:48:25,019 --> 00:48:29,096
that's really been able to scale into

958
00:48:26,009 --> 00:48:31,085
three dimensions are flash chips and

959
00:48:29,096 --> 00:48:34,103
that's part of the reason why my phone

960
00:48:32,066 --> 00:48:37,088
has 64 gigabytes I'm not bragging I'm

961
00:48:35,003 --> 00:48:40,028
just telling you my phone has 64

962
00:48:37,088 --> 00:48:41,141
gigabytes of memory you know why is

963
00:48:40,028 --> 00:48:45,029
there so much memory a flash memory

964
00:48:42,041 --> 00:48:47,135
available on a quest as you know is sort

965
00:48:45,038 --> 00:48:51,104
of the storage of choice in a

966
00:48:48,035 --> 00:48:56,044
solid-state disk on cell phones nowadays

967
00:48:52,004 --> 00:49:00,101
and so it's a it's based on

968
00:48:57,025 --> 00:49:05,039
semiconductor devices so for example

969
00:49:01,001 --> 00:49:08,048
this is a electron micrograph of a chip

970
00:49:05,039 --> 00:49:12,133
from samsung showing how they are able

971
00:49:08,048 --> 00:49:17,051
to create a sort of three-dimensional

972
00:49:13,033 --> 00:49:23,042
layering of memory cells so basically

973
00:49:17,078 --> 00:49:26,090
every spot in x y&z here is a one bits

974
00:49:24,023 --> 00:49:30,023
where it's actually two bits worth of

975
00:49:26,009 --> 00:49:32,728
of memory cell and there's some device

976
00:49:30,023 --> 00:49:35,027
there that can store it and then there's

977
00:49:33,619 --> 00:49:39,664
ways that you can access it to either

978
00:49:35,063 --> 00:49:42,152
read it or write it and they're able to

979
00:49:40,069 --> 00:49:47,074
do with this whole layering but by using

980
00:49:43,052 --> 00:49:48,361
only a fixed number of masking steps so

981
00:49:47,119 --> 00:49:51,187
basically what they start off with is

982
00:49:48,829 --> 00:49:56,000
they build up layers without any masking

983
00:49:51,799 --> 00:49:57,823
and then they put some masks there and

984
00:49:56,000 --> 00:50:02,069
then they zap down and they can sort of

985
00:49:58,039 --> 00:50:05,900
carve away of using basically ion beams

986
00:50:02,069 --> 00:50:07,115
to carve down wherever the mask is and

987
00:50:05,009 --> 00:50:10,138
pattern things then they can pour

988
00:50:08,015 --> 00:50:15,088
various types of goop in there that will

989
00:50:11,029 --> 00:50:18,500
fill up these spaces and so by some

990
00:50:15,088 --> 00:50:19,797
patterning only at the very top layer

991
00:50:18,005 --> 00:50:24,043
they can actually create this

992
00:50:20,589 --> 00:50:28,636
three-dimensional matrix of memory cells

993
00:50:24,088 --> 00:50:30,101
and they can now the most recent

994
00:50:29,059 --> 00:50:33,140
technology gets about 48 layers and

995
00:50:31,001 --> 00:50:34,540
there's projections that they'll be able

996
00:50:33,014 --> 00:50:36,733
to keep doing that at least through

997
00:50:34,549 --> 00:50:39,550
several hundred layers so my point is

998
00:50:36,859 --> 00:50:42,170
that you can actually do you don't

999
00:50:39,559 --> 00:50:45,562
necessarily need to do masking at every

1000
00:50:42,017 --> 00:50:49,666
single layer to create a 3-dimensional

1001
00:50:45,589 --> 00:50:52,591
structure now this doesn't scale in an

1002
00:50:49,819 --> 00:50:53,890
obvious way to computers or

1003
00:50:52,789 --> 00:50:57,470
microprocessors or anything with

1004
00:50:54,529 --> 00:51:00,760
computation it relies very heavily on

1005
00:50:57,047 --> 00:51:06,113
the fact that the particular circuit of

1006
00:51:00,076 --> 00:51:09,175
flash memory is very simple and fairly

1007
00:51:07,013 --> 00:51:12,412
easy to build in this 3-dimensional

1008
00:51:09,859 --> 00:51:14,660
structure but at least this is the kind

1009
00:51:12,529 --> 00:51:15,532
of idea of what will have to happen if

1010
00:51:14,066 --> 00:51:17,122
we're going to get this kind of

1011
00:51:15,829 --> 00:51:18,220
integration

1012
00:51:19,809 --> 00:51:25,910
but here's the harder one and this is a

1013
00:51:22,849 --> 00:51:28,891
problem just in general we're already up

1014
00:51:25,091 --> 00:51:34,210
against the serious power issues now so

1015
00:51:29,269 --> 00:51:37,366
if I look at a modern phone the only

1016
00:51:35,029 --> 00:51:40,126
drawers even when it's sort of working

1017
00:51:38,239 --> 00:51:43,273
hardest a couple of watts typically when

1018
00:51:40,999 --> 00:51:46,400
it's just if you want to walk around if

1019
00:51:43,579 --> 00:51:49,700
you want to have the battery be good for

1020
00:51:46,004 --> 00:51:54,163
a day at a time it has to draw a lot

1021
00:51:49,007 --> 00:51:55,336
less power than that so typically when

1022
00:51:54,559 --> 00:52:00,574
your phones and standby it's only

1023
00:51:56,029 --> 00:52:04,048
drawing a few of a few milliwatts so

1024
00:52:00,709 --> 00:52:05,740
maybe a hundredth of a watt but when it

1025
00:52:04,219 --> 00:52:08,281
needs to like you've just taken a

1026
00:52:06,019 --> 00:52:10,640
picture and it wants to do some image

1027
00:52:08,839 --> 00:52:12,886
processing on it or you're taking a

1028
00:52:10,064 --> 00:52:17,233
video or something like that it can

1029
00:52:13,309 --> 00:52:19,390
crank up to a couple watts of power so

1030
00:52:17,809 --> 00:52:20,905
why can't it go more than that one is as

1031
00:52:20,119 --> 00:52:25,190
I mentioned is the battery but the other

1032
00:52:21,769 --> 00:52:27,140
is if your phone draws more than a few

1033
00:52:25,019 --> 00:52:28,408
watts then you won't really want to walk

1034
00:52:27,014 --> 00:52:30,493
around with it in your pocket because

1035
00:52:28,579 --> 00:52:32,647
it'll be too hot so you know just

1036
00:52:30,619 --> 00:52:35,656
imagine a 25 watt light bulb if you put

1037
00:52:33,259 --> 00:52:38,262
that in your pocket and walked around as

1038
00:52:35,989 --> 00:52:40,015
far as the extension cord would let you

1039
00:52:38,289 --> 00:52:44,660
that wouldn't feel too good

1040
00:52:40,249 --> 00:52:46,348
so that limits the power isn't just

1041
00:52:44,066 --> 00:52:48,625
battery what so even if we come up with

1042
00:52:47,239 --> 00:52:52,273
better bed resources the other thing is

1043
00:52:49,219 --> 00:52:55,318
cooling so contrast that to the human

1044
00:52:52,579 --> 00:52:59,690
brain is actually pretty amazing as a

1045
00:52:56,209 --> 00:53:03,261
low power system so a human brain

1046
00:52:59,069 --> 00:53:07,438
contains roughly 64 billion neurons up

1047
00:53:03,729 --> 00:53:13,762
but it and it draws a few tens of watts

1048
00:53:08,059 --> 00:53:15,130
so more there's reasons than that so

1049
00:53:14,059 --> 00:53:17,900
it's a higher powered thing than a phone

1050
00:53:15,769 --> 00:53:19,843
but it's still a very low power system

1051
00:53:17,009 --> 00:53:21,958
so high power it's partly that's a

1052
00:53:20,509 --> 00:53:26,509
liquid-cooled system your brain circular

1053
00:53:22,849 --> 00:53:28,430
your body circulation system puts a lot

1054
00:53:26,509 --> 00:53:30,603
of its work into keeping your brain from

1055
00:53:28,043 --> 00:53:32,972
overheating and your body's metabolism

1056
00:53:31,449 --> 00:53:35,453
are you

1057
00:53:33,359 --> 00:53:37,910
for example you guys sitting here each

1058
00:53:35,489 --> 00:53:41,160
of you are drawing about sixty watts so

1059
00:53:37,091 --> 00:53:42,470
you like a 60 watt light bulb but about

1060
00:53:41,016 --> 00:53:45,695
a quarter of that power is is powering

1061
00:53:43,289 --> 00:53:48,390
the neurons in your brain so it's a

1062
00:53:45,839 --> 00:53:51,410
fairly big chunk of the human energy

1063
00:53:48,039 --> 00:53:53,468
budget is the brain which makes sense

1064
00:53:51,041 --> 00:53:55,670
but it's still more power than we're

1065
00:53:53,819 --> 00:53:59,864
really going to allow in our portable

1066
00:53:56,039 --> 00:54:06,118
devices if we don't want to our pits to

1067
00:54:00,269 --> 00:54:10,346
catch on fire and now the crazy thing is

1068
00:54:06,829 --> 00:54:14,160
but wait a minute I wanted to go up to

1069
00:54:11,039 --> 00:54:16,121
10 to the 17th of these devices five

1070
00:54:14,016 --> 00:54:19,475
hundred thousand times more and I don't

1071
00:54:16,859 --> 00:54:21,690
want to add any more power to this so

1072
00:54:19,619 --> 00:54:22,682
how is that going to happen well it's

1073
00:54:21,069 --> 00:54:24,868
certainly not going to happen with the

1074
00:54:23,249 --> 00:54:27,332
technology we have today that just can't

1075
00:54:25,489 --> 00:54:30,517
possibly meet those so we'll have to

1076
00:54:28,079 --> 00:54:33,083
have some fairly radically different

1077
00:54:30,769 --> 00:54:35,822
technology from a power perspective as

1078
00:54:33,119 --> 00:54:38,910
well and misko is also not just for

1079
00:54:36,299 --> 00:54:41,306
portable devices but even room size

1080
00:54:38,091 --> 00:54:43,940
building sized computers for example

1081
00:54:41,999 --> 00:54:47,130
right now the fastest computer in the

1082
00:54:44,759 --> 00:54:49,820
u.s. is at Oak Ridge National Labs

1083
00:54:47,013 --> 00:54:55,192
it's called Titan a fastest in the world

1084
00:54:50,369 --> 00:54:54,463
it's in China and both of them draw

1085
00:54:58,063 --> 00:55:07,067
roughly 10 megawatts okay of power so

1086
00:55:04,004 --> 00:55:11,953
the high-end supercomputers and one of

1087
00:55:07,067 --> 00:55:13,456
the goals that the supercomputing people

1088
00:55:12,349 --> 00:55:16,730
talked about is to scale to what they

1089
00:55:14,059 --> 00:55:20,150
call exascale meaning the ability to do

1090
00:55:16,073 --> 00:55:21,098
10 to the 18th operations per second

1091
00:55:20,015 --> 00:55:24,023
whether they call flops floating-point

1092
00:55:21,098 --> 00:55:25,163
operations per second so if you just

1093
00:55:24,023 --> 00:55:28,792
took Titan and said okay we want to make

1094
00:55:26,063 --> 00:55:33,682
it go a hundred times faster we'll just

1095
00:55:28,999 --> 00:55:38,050
put more so for example a Titan is built

1096
00:55:34,249 --> 00:55:41,257
out of 28,000 microprocessors and 28,000

1097
00:55:38,509 --> 00:55:47,380
GPUs so if we just go crank all that up

1098
00:55:42,049 --> 00:55:47,380
by a factor of 100 then you're talking

1099
00:55:47,529 --> 00:55:54,538
close to gigawatt of power so and just

1100
00:55:50,063 --> 00:55:56,147
roughly in rough terms the entire output

1101
00:55:54,619 --> 00:56:00,624
of the Hoover Dam is is would be enough

1102
00:55:57,047 --> 00:56:03,136
to power a 1 gigawatt system so our

1103
00:56:01,119 --> 00:56:06,440
small nuclear power plant could do it

1104
00:56:03,559 --> 00:56:09,650
too but the point is power is going to

1105
00:56:06,044 --> 00:56:12,403
be a big issue for both portable things

1106
00:56:09,065 --> 00:56:17,934
and for all of computing as we go

1107
00:56:12,799 --> 00:56:21,440
forward ok so that's sort of some of the

1108
00:56:18,519 --> 00:56:23,578
technical challenges accommodation but

1109
00:56:21,044 --> 00:56:27,071
another is an economic challenge is that

1110
00:56:24,109 --> 00:56:32,134
it turns out that semiconductor business

1111
00:56:27,071 --> 00:56:35,146
has become more capital intensive and

1112
00:56:32,359 --> 00:56:40,640
harder to to sustain and so this is a

1113
00:56:36,046 --> 00:56:42,705
example of all the companies that we're

1114
00:56:40,064 --> 00:56:46,070
able to manufacture chips at different

1115
00:56:43,119 --> 00:56:50,191
physical sizes so that it's a little bit

1116
00:56:46,007 --> 00:56:53,866
out of date the the latest chips are are

1117
00:56:50,839 --> 00:56:56,839
14 nanometers but you see that we're

1118
00:56:54,559 --> 00:56:59,180
basically down to four companies in the

1119
00:56:56,839 --> 00:57:00,936
world who have the wherewithal to

1120
00:56:59,018 --> 00:57:06,637
manufacture state-of-the-art

1121
00:57:01,809 --> 00:57:09,230
semiconductor systems and and so and

1122
00:57:06,799 --> 00:57:11,340
these are just to let you know tsmc is

1123
00:57:09,023 --> 00:57:16,032
Taiwan semiconductor manufacturer

1124
00:57:11,034 --> 00:57:18,123
they're huge in producing chips for

1125
00:57:16,032 --> 00:57:21,108
other customers basically what they call

1126
00:57:19,023 --> 00:57:27,078
foundry so other designs come in so for

1127
00:57:22,008 --> 00:57:30,012
example TSMC historically has been the

1128
00:57:27,078 --> 00:57:32,165
main vendor for apple for almost all

1129
00:57:30,048 --> 00:57:36,093
android phones are manufactured by tsmc

1130
00:57:33,065 --> 00:57:39,074
intel you know intel but they very much

1131
00:57:36,093 --> 00:57:42,147
rely completely for their business on on

1132
00:57:40,055 --> 00:57:49,086
microprocessors and other things they

1133
00:57:43,047 --> 00:57:51,081
are that and they only with a small

1134
00:57:49,086 --> 00:57:54,092
exception only manufactured chips for

1135
00:57:51,081 --> 00:57:57,126
their own use their own company

1136
00:57:54,092 --> 00:58:00,171
samsung as you know is in korea is a

1137
00:57:58,026 --> 00:58:04,029
leading manufacturer and a lot of what

1138
00:58:01,071 --> 00:58:07,164
they do is produce chips for samsung

1139
00:58:04,029 --> 00:58:11,034
products but they also are one of the

1140
00:58:08,064 --> 00:58:13,137
biggest vendors of memory they also

1141
00:58:11,079 --> 00:58:15,105
actually interestingly manufactures some

1142
00:58:14,037 --> 00:58:18,051
of the chips for apples so if you think

1143
00:58:16,005 --> 00:58:23,073
about the phone business who are the big

1144
00:58:18,051 --> 00:58:25,080
competitors Samsung Apple but Samsung

1145
00:58:23,073 --> 00:58:27,098
actually builds Apple's chips Apple has

1146
00:58:25,008 --> 00:58:29,043
no manufacturing capabilities whatsoever

1147
00:58:27,098 --> 00:58:31,131
and then the fourth one is the one

1148
00:58:30,015 --> 00:58:35,048
called Global Foundries which is a

1149
00:58:32,031 --> 00:58:40,080
company that sort of swept up all the

1150
00:58:35,048 --> 00:58:43,053
second string players and it's actually

1151
00:58:40,008 --> 00:58:47,103
owned by the sovereign wealth fund of

1152
00:58:43,098 --> 00:58:52,149
the Abu Dhabi so one of the United Arab

1153
00:58:48,075 --> 00:58:55,142
Emirates so really if you're you can

1154
00:58:53,049 --> 00:58:59,076
think that there's two companies in Asia

1155
00:58:56,042 --> 00:59:02,046
one that's headquartered in Abu Dhabi

1156
00:58:59,076 --> 00:59:03,171
but it's actually physically other

1157
00:59:02,046 --> 00:59:10,047
manufacturing facilities are in the u.s.

1158
00:59:04,071 --> 00:59:11,166
in Germany and in Singapore Intel all of

1159
00:59:10,056 --> 00:59:14,097
its manufacturing is in the u.s. Taiwan

1160
00:59:12,066 --> 00:59:18,122
is at least through the leading edge all

1161
00:59:14,097 --> 00:59:22,134
in Taiwan and Samsung they have a fab in

1162
00:59:19,022 --> 00:59:23,115
Texas and in Korea so anyways my point

1163
00:59:23,034 --> 00:59:26,040
is

1164
00:59:24,015 --> 00:59:28,724
this isn't very many if you think of a

1165
00:59:26,004 --> 00:59:30,102
300 billion dollar industry and sort of

1166
00:59:28,859 --> 00:59:33,180
where we're betting our future on you

1167
00:59:31,038 --> 00:59:34,247
only have four companies really that are

1168
00:59:33,018 --> 00:59:37,023
in the business right now is a little

1169
00:59:34,589 --> 00:59:39,662
bit scary and as you see if this trend

1170
00:59:37,068 --> 00:59:43,092
continues things wouldn't go well and

1171
00:59:40,319 --> 00:59:46,140
particularly if we want innovation and

1172
00:59:43,092 --> 00:59:48,117
progress to happen we need competition

1173
00:59:46,014 --> 00:59:51,021
and if the number of companies dropped

1174
00:59:49,017 --> 00:59:54,050
to small then the competition won't be

1175
00:59:51,021 --> 00:59:57,119
as significant either so these are

1176
00:59:54,005 --> 00:59:57,074
interesting questions

1177
01:00:00,061 --> 01:00:05,153
another thing that making life difficult

1178
01:00:04,001 --> 01:00:09,002
and it's been making life difficult for

1179
01:00:06,053 --> 01:00:11,054
the last ten years is what sometimes

1180
01:00:09,011 --> 01:00:13,109
referred to as Dennard scaling and this

1181
01:00:11,054 --> 01:00:16,100
is a term that you'll hear said nowadays

1182
01:00:14,009 --> 01:00:19,058
and just a few years ago if you

1183
01:00:17,000 --> 01:00:21,005
mentioned that term people would have no

1184
01:00:19,058 --> 01:00:23,129
idea what you're talking about unless

1185
01:00:21,005 --> 01:00:26,020
you were pretty heavy into chips but

1186
01:00:24,029 --> 01:00:29,108
there's a fellow named Robert Denard who

1187
01:00:26,065 --> 01:00:32,159
had a long career at IBM he actually got

1188
01:00:30,008 --> 01:00:36,071
his PhD here from Carnegie Tech in the

1189
01:00:33,059 --> 01:00:37,091
1950s and among other things he invented

1190
01:00:36,071 --> 01:00:42,092
the dynamic Ram

1191
01:00:37,091 --> 01:00:45,149
so DRAM you know he's a guy but he wrote

1192
01:00:42,092 --> 01:00:49,103
a very interesting paper in in 1974 that

1193
01:00:46,049 --> 01:00:52,049
sort of sketched out why it is that by

1194
01:00:50,003 --> 01:00:55,075
shrinking chips we a life gets better

1195
01:00:52,049 --> 01:00:59,105
and it's a very simple model sort of

1196
01:00:55,075 --> 01:01:04,100
simple area geometry basics of Ohm's law

1197
01:01:00,005 --> 01:01:08,021
kind of stuff that that tells you what

1198
01:01:05,000 --> 01:01:12,026
it's doing but he said imagine we can

1199
01:01:08,021 --> 01:01:15,077
shrink a chip all the features on a chip

1200
01:01:12,026 --> 01:01:17,120
by a factor of some number K if you

1201
01:01:15,077 --> 01:01:22,121
typically really say 2 or the square

1202
01:01:18,002 --> 01:01:25,078
root of 2 so if you can shrink in both x

1203
01:01:23,021 --> 01:01:29,078
and y directions by a factor of K and

1204
01:01:25,096 --> 01:01:31,121
this is a big important hand and we also

1205
01:01:29,078 --> 01:01:34,163
reduce the supply voltage to the chip by

1206
01:01:32,021 --> 01:01:37,025
that same factor then obviously we're

1207
01:01:35,063 --> 01:01:42,076
going to increase the number of devices

1208
01:01:37,061 --> 01:01:44,069
by a factor of K squared right but also

1209
01:01:42,076 --> 01:01:47,128
we'll be able to make these run faster

1210
01:01:45,041 --> 01:01:51,083
and we'll be able to do it without

1211
01:01:48,028 --> 01:01:54,125
requiring more power per chip so if all

1212
01:01:51,083 --> 01:01:57,155
this scaling holds then we can get more

1213
01:01:55,025 --> 01:02:00,118
stuff on a chip run it faster and not

1214
01:01:58,055 --> 01:02:04,091
use more power so that sort of the

1215
01:02:01,018 --> 01:02:07,082
principle of Dennard scaling and that's

1216
01:02:04,091 --> 01:02:13,144
really what was followed by the industry

1217
01:02:07,082 --> 01:02:18,181
for from about 75 to about

1218
01:02:14,044 --> 01:02:21,113
2004 this is a chart that shows how

1219
01:02:19,081 --> 01:02:24,089
technology progressed so the top curve

1220
01:02:22,013 --> 01:02:29,045
here is Moore's law how many transistors

1221
01:02:24,089 --> 01:02:33,125
were on a chip this next curve down was

1222
01:02:29,045 --> 01:02:36,074
how fast could a microprocessor go

1223
01:02:34,025 --> 01:02:40,051
running a single threat of execution and

1224
01:02:36,074 --> 01:02:43,076
you see it was following a sort of nice

1225
01:02:40,051 --> 01:02:45,095
steady growth curve what was the

1226
01:02:43,076 --> 01:02:48,095
frequency the clock frequency of the

1227
01:02:45,095 --> 01:02:50,126
chip you saw also followed this nice

1228
01:02:48,095 --> 01:02:53,141
growth curve until it hit about two

1229
01:02:51,026 --> 01:02:57,089
gigahertz how many watts per chip well

1230
01:02:54,041 --> 01:03:03,059
it's kind of variable but it was more or

1231
01:02:57,089 --> 01:03:04,151
less it was going faster than Dennard

1232
01:03:03,059 --> 01:03:08,066
scaling predicted but still pretty

1233
01:03:05,051 --> 01:03:11,129
reasonable and how many cores would we

1234
01:03:09,029 --> 01:03:13,073
put on a chip well it was one for a

1235
01:03:12,029 --> 01:03:18,055
really long time and then they started

1236
01:03:13,073 --> 01:03:21,158
anymore so the main point to notice is

1237
01:03:18,055 --> 01:03:26,120
somewhere actually it was a right around

1238
01:03:22,058 --> 01:03:29,066
2005 things stopped progressing Moore's

1239
01:03:27,002 --> 01:03:32,090
law continues it continues today we can

1240
01:03:29,066 --> 01:03:35,069
get more stuff on a chip than before but

1241
01:03:33,008 --> 01:03:38,042
how fast a given thread goes has not

1242
01:03:35,069 --> 01:03:40,112
really improved much in the past of 10

1243
01:03:38,042 --> 01:03:43,061
years and that's why the shark machines

1244
01:03:41,012 --> 01:03:49,015
which are already 5 years old are

1245
01:03:43,061 --> 01:03:53,120
actually pretty viable computers which

1246
01:03:49,015 --> 01:03:57,083
and the number of watts has leveled off

1247
01:03:54,002 --> 01:03:59,084
not because that's the best thing

1248
01:03:57,083 --> 01:04:05,120
computing wise but that's because you

1249
01:04:00,002 --> 01:04:08,063
just can't afford to the cost of the

1250
01:04:06,002 --> 01:04:12,029
actual electricity cost as well as all

1251
01:04:08,063 --> 01:04:14,156
the requirements for cooling and things

1252
01:04:12,047 --> 01:04:17,096
that comes with increased power and so

1253
01:04:15,056 --> 01:04:20,102
that combination is the reason why we've

1254
01:04:17,096 --> 01:04:23,099
gone multi-core that we couldn't get

1255
01:04:21,002 --> 01:04:26,060
improved single-threaded performance but

1256
01:04:24,026 --> 01:04:27,040
we could improve the number of

1257
01:04:26,006 --> 01:04:28,087
transistors

1258
01:04:27,004 --> 01:04:37,683
chip so what do we do we just make more

1259
01:04:29,041 --> 01:04:40,470
cores and so my so so some will tell you

1260
01:04:38,079 --> 01:04:43,104
that Moore's law is already dead in the

1261
01:04:40,839 --> 01:04:44,865
sense that for a while there is a sort

1262
01:04:43,329 --> 01:04:47,950
of miraculous things just kept getting

1263
01:04:45,099 --> 01:04:50,230
better and better every year because of

1264
01:04:47,095 --> 01:04:51,121
Moore's law and now we're already in an

1265
01:04:50,023 --> 01:04:54,582
era that even though the transistor

1266
01:04:52,021 --> 01:04:56,340
density part of Moore's law holds some

1267
01:04:54,789 --> 01:05:00,940
of these other performance factors have

1268
01:04:56,529 --> 01:05:04,660
not improved so it's in getting

1269
01:05:00,094 --> 01:05:07,143
difficult to sort of use this technology

1270
01:05:04,066 --> 01:05:10,725
to make things faster and more powerful

1271
01:05:08,043 --> 01:05:13,099
and so I'll mention for example part of

1272
01:05:11,319 --> 01:05:14,418
the reason why this phone actually I

1273
01:05:13,099 --> 01:05:16,908
don't know how many transistors are in

1274
01:05:15,309 --> 01:05:19,314
this phone but if you think at two

1275
01:05:17,799 --> 01:05:22,450
billion transistors the model before

1276
01:05:19,809 --> 01:05:24,400
that had 1 billion you say well what

1277
01:05:22,045 --> 01:05:26,394
what are all these transistors doing

1278
01:05:24,004 --> 01:05:28,383
part of what they've done is and part of

1279
01:05:26,799 --> 01:05:32,805
the reason they're able to keep the

1280
01:05:28,779 --> 01:05:35,190
power down is a lot of what's on a they

1281
01:05:32,859 --> 01:05:37,450
call the the chip now it's not called a

1282
01:05:35,019 --> 01:05:37,638
microprocessor it's called a system on a

1283
01:05:37,045 --> 01:05:40,674
chip

1284
01:05:37,809 --> 01:05:45,460
because embedded on it will be a couple

1285
01:05:41,079 --> 01:05:48,880
of arm microprocessors several graphic

1286
01:05:45,046 --> 01:05:50,140
processing units to handle the video the

1287
01:05:48,088 --> 01:05:52,144
image processing and other specialized

1288
01:05:51,004 --> 01:05:55,623
pieces of hardware that are only used

1289
01:05:53,044 --> 01:06:00,653
for very specific things so for example

1290
01:05:56,019 --> 01:06:03,054
there's a JPEG encoding and decoding is

1291
01:06:01,049 --> 01:06:06,700
directly integrated into Hardware on

1292
01:06:03,369 --> 01:06:08,432
this chip there's a actually some

1293
01:06:06,007 --> 01:06:11,886
special logic for when you take

1294
01:06:08,999 --> 01:06:15,220
panoramic shots and then you merge those

1295
01:06:12,579 --> 01:06:17,583
all together which I don't know about

1296
01:06:15,022 --> 01:06:19,311
you but I don't do that very often but

1297
01:06:17,619 --> 01:06:20,694
there's still some special dedicated

1298
01:06:19,509 --> 01:06:22,536
Hardware on those chips to do that

1299
01:06:21,369 --> 01:06:25,480
because it takes a lot of power

1300
01:06:22,779 --> 01:06:28,830
otherwise so in general if you can take

1301
01:06:25,048 --> 01:06:31,857
a some compute computing and turn it

1302
01:06:29,289 --> 01:06:34,371
from software and migrate it to hardware

1303
01:06:32,289 --> 01:06:37,720
you get a big performance increase and a

1304
01:06:35,109 --> 01:06:39,430
major power reduction so they're putting

1305
01:06:37,072 --> 01:06:39,150
more stuff on a chip not to give you

1306
01:06:39,043 --> 01:06:43,050
more possible

1307
01:06:40,005 --> 01:06:47,043
powerful processor but to be able to do

1308
01:06:44,013 --> 01:06:51,015
more stuff at lower power so that's why

1309
01:06:47,088 --> 01:06:52,089
these chips get more so my point is that

1310
01:06:51,033 --> 01:06:56,115
they're already sort of we're already in

1311
01:06:52,098 --> 01:06:58,173
an era when the driving reason for

1312
01:06:57,015 --> 01:07:01,083
Moore's law isn't so much to get raw

1313
01:06:59,073 --> 01:07:04,145
performance out of these systems but to

1314
01:07:01,083 --> 01:07:05,166
give you more features various sorts

1315
01:07:05,045 --> 01:07:13,047
okay

1316
01:07:06,066 --> 01:07:16,127
so looking to the future then as I said

1317
01:07:13,065 --> 01:07:20,130
it you can look at since 65 it's been a

1318
01:07:17,027 --> 01:07:23,112
very long set of incremental

1319
01:07:21,003 --> 01:07:27,039
improvements to get from the chips of

1320
01:07:24,012 --> 01:07:30,035
Gordon Moore's early career to where we

1321
01:07:27,066 --> 01:07:33,066
are today we got more stuff on a chip

1322
01:07:30,035 --> 01:07:35,112
vastly more capable much more affordable

1323
01:07:33,066 --> 01:07:37,107
huge impact on it but from a technology

1324
01:07:36,012 --> 01:07:40,065
point of view it's been a fairly

1325
01:07:38,007 --> 01:07:42,012
incremental road to travel we can see

1326
01:07:40,065 --> 01:07:42,141
that that's not going to work in the

1327
01:07:42,012 --> 01:07:48,027
future we're not going to be able to

1328
01:07:43,041 --> 01:07:53,067
scale transistor logic to the level that

1329
01:07:48,027 --> 01:07:57,072
you'd need to keep this going so at

1330
01:07:53,067 --> 01:08:00,096
least two-dimensional semiconductor

1331
01:07:57,072 --> 01:08:03,093
chips aren't going to carry the way so

1332
01:08:00,096 --> 01:08:04,173
they sort of issues then and you and

1333
01:08:03,093 --> 01:08:08,175
your careers will be dealing with these

1334
01:08:05,073 --> 01:08:11,118
is will we be able to build systems of

1335
01:08:09,075 --> 01:08:13,136
this complexity in a way that's

1336
01:08:12,018 --> 01:08:16,367
commercially viable because if it's not

1337
01:08:14,036 --> 01:08:18,117
economically viable it's just not going

1338
01:08:16,529 --> 01:08:22,556
to happen and power is going to be a

1339
01:08:19,017 --> 01:08:24,356
huge problem as we go along and then you

1340
01:08:22,799 --> 01:08:28,140
know what would it mean if you actually

1341
01:08:24,509 --> 01:08:30,515
had 10 to the 17th I can't think of what

1342
01:08:28,014 --> 01:08:34,110
possible capabilities this would give us

1343
01:08:31,109 --> 01:08:37,118
that we'd actually want use but again if

1344
01:08:35,001 --> 01:08:40,760
I don't think Gordon Moore would have

1345
01:08:38,009 --> 01:08:42,930
thought back in 60 if you look at the 65

1346
01:08:40,859 --> 01:08:43,955
paper I recommend you do he actually did

1347
01:08:42,093 --> 01:08:46,022
predict things like personal computers

1348
01:08:44,819 --> 01:08:50,520
and cell phones believe it or not it's

1349
01:08:46,859 --> 01:08:53,160
really true um so he was definitely

1350
01:08:50,052 --> 01:08:53,117
pretty good but for me I can't predict

1351
01:08:53,016 --> 01:08:56,054
what I

1352
01:08:54,017 --> 01:08:59,075
have in 50 years what I do with it and

1353
01:08:56,054 --> 01:09:00,149
then for more the software people you

1354
01:08:59,075 --> 01:09:04,159
know what what mean will there be

1355
01:09:01,049 --> 01:09:05,050
programming we certainly won't be

1356
01:09:05,065 --> 01:09:11,066
writing lines of code in C in order to

1357
01:09:08,084 --> 01:09:13,091
power systems like this so what will

1358
01:09:11,066 --> 01:09:18,149
that mean for the future those are all

1359
01:09:13,091 --> 01:09:21,103
big questions that you and this point of

1360
01:09:19,049 --> 01:09:25,111
your careers get to look forward to so I

1361
01:09:22,003 --> 01:09:26,011
wish you the best in doing that
