1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,899
hello everyone I'd like to welcome you

2
00:00:02,879 --> 00:00:10,620
all to this fall's this term's instance

3
00:00:06,899 --> 00:00:14,700
of this course is officially either 15

4
00:00:10,062 --> 00:00:16,064
to 13 from computer science or 18 to 13

5
00:00:14,007 --> 00:00:18,051
from Electrical and Computer Engineering

6
00:00:16,064 --> 00:00:20,963
but a large number the people enrolled

7
00:00:19,014 --> 00:00:25,107
in this course are in one called 513

8
00:00:21,539 --> 00:00:27,563
which is for graduate students and to be

9
00:00:26,007 --> 00:00:29,636
totally honest you're not supposed to be

10
00:00:27,779 --> 00:00:32,880
here because you're supposed to watch

11
00:00:29,699 --> 00:00:36,000
the videos the lectures by video later

12
00:00:32,088 --> 00:00:36,135
but we're not checking any card so I

13
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:42,000
don't really know who you are

14
00:00:37,035 --> 00:00:43,044
Oh anyways this course is as you can see

15
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:48,044
a very popular course on campus we have

16
00:00:44,025 --> 00:00:51,314
over 700 700 600 shouldn't exaggerate

17
00:00:48,044 --> 00:00:54,060
students on campus enrolled in one of

18
00:00:51,539 --> 00:00:56,340
those three versions of the course which

19
00:00:54,006 --> 00:00:59,555
if you think about a university of the

20
00:00:56,034 --> 00:01:04,813
size of CMU that's like about five

21
00:01:00,149 --> 00:01:10,178
percent of the total student population

22
00:01:05,119 --> 00:01:14,070
so we're very glad to have you here

23
00:01:10,439 --> 00:01:17,820
and this game is too high I think we

24
00:01:14,007 --> 00:01:22,916
overdid the game try that that's better

25
00:01:17,082 --> 00:01:24,099
um so my name is Randy Bryant and my

26
00:01:22,979 --> 00:01:27,032
co-instructor is Dave O'Halloran and

27
00:01:24,099 --> 00:01:29,152
those names might be familiar if you

28
00:01:27,509 --> 00:01:33,430
have been to the bookstore

29
00:01:30,052 --> 00:01:36,100
because the book was written by us and

30
00:01:33,043 --> 00:01:42,124
we actually wrote this book we started

31
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:45,007
to 13 as a course in 1998 ah and I know

32
00:01:43,024 --> 00:01:48,052
that your children them and all that

33
00:01:45,007 --> 00:01:50,095
stuff but out of response for a new type

34
00:01:48,052 --> 00:01:53,056
of course that you'll see today that

35
00:01:50,095 --> 00:01:55,192
sort of gives people a in-depth

36
00:01:53,056 --> 00:01:58,081
understanding of systems but more from a

37
00:01:56,092 --> 00:01:59,149
high-level or programmers perspective

38
00:01:58,081 --> 00:02:03,085
and we'll talk some about the philosophy

39
00:02:00,049 --> 00:02:06,075
of the course later so this book has

40
00:02:03,085 --> 00:02:09,444
used Co just came out its third edition

41
00:02:06,075 --> 00:02:12,151
last March and that's the required text

42
00:02:10,209 --> 00:02:16,215
for the course and there is nothing you

43
00:02:13,051 --> 00:02:18,139
can do to avoid buying that book and

44
00:02:16,269 --> 00:02:21,640
it's not because we're greedy actually

45
00:02:19,039 --> 00:02:24,100
we take the money we get from royalty

46
00:02:21,064 --> 00:02:26,103
for students in this course or any CMU

47
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:29,029
course and we donate it to CMU

48
00:02:27,003 --> 00:02:31,069
so we're not actually making any money

49
00:02:29,029 --> 00:02:34,029
out of you buying the book but it's a

50
00:02:31,069 --> 00:02:37,132
simple reality that the new version is

51
00:02:34,029 --> 00:02:40,051
different than the old we expect you to

52
00:02:38,032 --> 00:02:43,123
be using the new version there are no

53
00:02:40,051 --> 00:02:46,084
electronic copies there are no pirated

54
00:02:44,023 --> 00:02:49,060
versions so you basically have to buy

55
00:02:46,084 --> 00:02:52,117
the book but and I don't really

56
00:02:49,006 --> 00:02:55,039
apologize to that because I know you or

57
00:02:53,017 --> 00:02:57,076
your parents do somebody's paying a lot

58
00:02:55,093 --> 00:02:59,101
of money for you to be here and so the

59
00:02:57,076 --> 00:03:03,085
price of the book is really a relatively

60
00:03:00,001 --> 00:03:06,040
small amount relative to that and this

61
00:03:03,085 --> 00:03:08,116
course by the way is not some courses

62
00:03:06,004 --> 00:03:10,018
there's oh yeah this book you might want

63
00:03:09,016 --> 00:03:12,034
to look at it once in a while but

64
00:03:10,054 --> 00:03:14,062
actually the course has nothing to do

65
00:03:12,034 --> 00:03:17,068
with it this course the book and the

66
00:03:15,034 --> 00:03:20,059
courts are one they're very tied

67
00:03:17,068 --> 00:03:23,937
together there'll be parts of the book

68
00:03:20,059 --> 00:03:25,066
that we don't go into all the details

69
00:03:24,549 --> 00:03:27,850
that are in the book sometimes but we

70
00:03:26,029 --> 00:03:32,095
expect you to be able to figure it out

71
00:03:27,085 --> 00:03:34,120
and so really the course in the book are

72
00:03:32,095 --> 00:03:36,354
tied together and they very much the the

73
00:03:35,002 --> 00:03:39,013
progress of the course the topics

74
00:03:37,209 --> 00:03:42,150
covered how it's covered everything

75
00:03:39,031 --> 00:03:41,115
about it is

76
00:03:43,018 --> 00:03:47,997
consistent with the book and we wrote

77
00:03:45,519 --> 00:03:52,450
the book because of the course think of

78
00:03:48,159 --> 00:03:54,159
them as course notes so and the reason

79
00:03:52,045 --> 00:03:55,284
why we are teaching this term by the way

80
00:03:54,159 --> 00:03:58,150
we haven't taught together in several

81
00:03:55,689 --> 00:04:01,120
years but because this is the first roll

82
00:03:58,015 --> 00:04:02,934
out of this book and not only is it

83
00:04:01,012 --> 00:04:06,081
being used here but it's actually used

84
00:04:03,069 --> 00:04:09,700
by about 250 schools around the world

85
00:04:06,189 --> 00:04:13,840
and many of those people are also going

86
00:04:09,007 --> 00:04:15,216
through the same activities of teaching

87
00:04:13,084 --> 00:04:17,943
for it from this new edition for the

88
00:04:15,909 --> 00:04:20,620
first time and so we wanted to make sure

89
00:04:18,699 --> 00:04:23,050
all the material for the course was sort

90
00:04:20,062 --> 00:04:26,074
of put in order and things because other

91
00:04:23,005 --> 00:04:29,044
universities and other colleges use this

92
00:04:26,074 --> 00:04:32,128
material of the supporting material

93
00:04:29,044 --> 00:04:35,101
we've developed so that's the course and

94
00:04:33,028 --> 00:04:38,083
today is the first election we're sort

95
00:04:36,001 --> 00:04:40,078
of doing a tag team here I'll talk the

96
00:04:38,083 --> 00:04:42,732
high level what the course is about what

97
00:04:40,078 --> 00:04:49,078
the main themes are and Dave will talk

98
00:04:43,479 --> 00:04:55,810
more about the logistics so we refer the

99
00:04:49,078 --> 00:04:58,457
the saying we have when the very first

100
00:04:55,081 --> 00:05:02,083
time I typed the number of this course

101
00:04:59,159 --> 00:05:05,530
into a text editor I realized I have

102
00:05:03,001 --> 00:05:08,059
typed those five digits many times in my

103
00:05:05,053 --> 00:05:10,932
career because it's the zip code of CMU

104
00:05:08,059 --> 00:05:18,888
one five two one three so that's where

105
00:05:11,409 --> 00:05:22,090
we come up with the same so um there's a

106
00:05:19,419 --> 00:05:24,580
few things about this course for the

107
00:05:22,009 --> 00:05:26,056
most part you know in your normal

108
00:05:24,058 --> 00:05:28,137
undergraduate curriculum when you've

109
00:05:26,056 --> 00:05:30,121
learned programming you've been very

110
00:05:28,659 --> 00:05:33,610
much separated from the realities of the

111
00:05:31,021 --> 00:05:38,080
Machine you just think about code just

112
00:05:33,061 --> 00:05:43,078
you put some text into some little box

113
00:05:38,008 --> 00:05:44,086
somehow and outcomes of behavior that it

114
00:05:43,078 --> 00:05:47,146
hopefully is what you intended the

115
00:05:45,058 --> 00:05:49,767
program to do the purpose of this course

116
00:05:48,046 --> 00:05:52,725
is to give you enough understanding of

117
00:05:50,289 --> 00:05:56,900
what that box is doing when it executes

118
00:05:53,139 --> 00:06:00,410
your code and through that to help you

119
00:05:56,009 --> 00:06:03,868
of become better at what you're trying

120
00:06:00,041 --> 00:06:06,640
to do so some of the outcomes is there's

121
00:06:04,759 --> 00:06:09,500
really two types of outcomes from this

122
00:06:07,009 --> 00:06:11,300
course one is that if this is the only

123
00:06:09,005 --> 00:06:13,052
systems course you ever take in your

124
00:06:11,003 --> 00:06:16,055
whole life you will get useful material

125
00:06:13,097 --> 00:06:19,636
from it you will learn tools tricks

126
00:06:16,082 --> 00:06:22,111
methods that will help you if you ever

127
00:06:20,509 --> 00:06:25,580
are in involved in software development

128
00:06:23,011 --> 00:06:28,109
large-scale software engineering

129
00:06:25,058 --> 00:06:32,069
projects systems hardware design any

130
00:06:29,009 --> 00:06:35,060
aspect of computer technology this will

131
00:06:32,069 --> 00:06:37,094
help you be better at what you do you'll

132
00:06:35,006 --> 00:06:39,080
understand what programs do how they

133
00:06:37,094 --> 00:06:41,102
work what the machines that support them

134
00:06:40,034 --> 00:06:44,083
do why sometimes they work really well

135
00:06:42,074 --> 00:06:47,159
and why sometimes they don't work so

136
00:06:44,389 --> 00:06:50,900
well it also is intended as a sort of

137
00:06:48,059 --> 00:06:54,134
stepping stone into a whole number of

138
00:06:50,009 --> 00:06:57,047
other courses at CMU that will give you

139
00:06:55,034 --> 00:06:59,953
more in-depth understanding of computer

140
00:06:58,028 --> 00:07:02,036
technology but our sort of specialized

141
00:07:00,259 --> 00:07:05,331
by topical area whether it's computer

142
00:07:03,008 --> 00:07:09,050
networking or operating systems or

143
00:07:05,979 --> 00:07:11,120
embedded systems where you'll take the

144
00:07:09,005 --> 00:07:13,052
sort of ideas from this course and be

145
00:07:11,012 --> 00:07:16,031
able to then learn in a somewhat

146
00:07:13,097 --> 00:07:19,100
narrower but deeper sense what's really

147
00:07:16,031 --> 00:07:22,043
going on and so it really is trying to

148
00:07:20,027 --> 00:07:24,736
serve those two goals of making you more

149
00:07:22,043 --> 00:07:27,022
effective giving you useful ideas and

150
00:07:24,979 --> 00:07:30,860
tools right away but also preparing you

151
00:07:27,409 --> 00:07:33,463
for later courses so one way we talk

152
00:07:30,086 --> 00:07:35,425
about this instead of what why what kind

153
00:07:33,949 --> 00:07:39,800
of stuff will you learn from this course

154
00:07:36,199 --> 00:07:42,830
is to go through a series of what we

155
00:07:39,008 --> 00:07:45,367
call great realities places where sort

156
00:07:42,083 --> 00:07:47,542
of computers meet up real-life computers

157
00:07:46,159 --> 00:07:50,191
get meet up against your expectations

158
00:07:48,289 --> 00:07:52,460
and maybe they're not quite the same so

159
00:07:50,479 --> 00:07:53,840
one of them is and the first part of the

160
00:07:52,046 --> 00:07:55,375
course is going to take a fairly

161
00:07:53,084 --> 00:07:57,143
detailed look how numbers are

162
00:07:55,789 --> 00:08:00,740
represented in computers and you'll

163
00:07:58,043 --> 00:08:02,782
learn some things that are on one hand

164
00:08:00,074 --> 00:08:03,973
surprising and another hand will start

165
00:08:03,169 --> 00:08:09,730
to make sense when you understand it

166
00:08:04,639 --> 00:08:15,140
better so a simple case is

167
00:08:09,073 --> 00:08:15,152
for numbers I don't know when it was but

168
00:08:15,014 --> 00:08:18,095
it was probably in about eighth grade

169
00:08:16,052 --> 00:08:20,117
algebra that I learned that if you

170
00:08:18,095 --> 00:08:23,096
square a number it will be at least zero

171
00:08:21,017 --> 00:08:27,083
if it's not an imaginary number so a

172
00:08:24,005 --> 00:08:29,099
either an integer or a real number you'd

173
00:08:27,083 --> 00:08:33,155
expect to square it and it to be a

174
00:08:29,099 --> 00:08:36,268
positive value or perhaps zero right and

175
00:08:34,055 --> 00:08:38,099
that's actually generally true with

176
00:08:37,159 --> 00:08:44,450
floats a representation of floating

177
00:08:38,099 --> 00:08:46,103
point numbers but with integers or int

178
00:08:44,045 --> 00:08:50,045
you know the computer representation of

179
00:08:47,003 --> 00:08:52,010
integers it's not so clear so for

180
00:08:50,045 --> 00:08:55,124
example if you square 40,000 on most

181
00:08:52,073 --> 00:08:59,126
computers then you'll get whatever that

182
00:08:56,024 --> 00:09:04,067
should be as you'd expect but what if

183
00:09:00,026 --> 00:09:07,085
you square 50,000 so you could do this

184
00:09:04,067 --> 00:09:10,079
in your head but I actually built into

185
00:09:07,085 --> 00:09:13,096
this laptop is a computer so I'm going

186
00:09:10,079 --> 00:09:13,096
to go ahead and use it

187
00:09:16,072 --> 00:09:20,691
we just size it a little bit

188
00:09:23,078 --> 00:09:43,091
and use a tool which on UNIX systems is

189
00:09:30,047 --> 00:09:47,090
called know what's going on before here

190
00:09:43,091 --> 00:09:50,189
we are on Linux systems is called gdb

191
00:09:47,009 --> 00:09:52,013
but on a Macintosh OS X it's called L LD

192
00:09:51,089 --> 00:09:54,122
B but they're pretty much the same

193
00:09:53,003 --> 00:09:58,046
program you will get to know this

194
00:09:55,022 --> 00:10:02,086
program really really well this terms so

195
00:09:58,073 --> 00:10:08,165
like I said a few square 40-thousand

196
00:10:02,086 --> 00:10:17,171
you'll get what you'd expect but let's

197
00:10:09,065 --> 00:10:19,163
change this to 50,000 and you get a very

198
00:10:18,071 --> 00:10:22,079
peculiar number that doesn't look

199
00:10:20,063 --> 00:10:24,089
anything like you'd expect 50,000

200
00:10:22,079 --> 00:10:28,106
squared to be and in fact it's negative

201
00:10:24,089 --> 00:10:30,116
and so that might just seem like well

202
00:10:29,006 --> 00:10:34,030
there must be a mistake or something no

203
00:10:31,016 --> 00:10:37,025
that that's just the way it is because

204
00:10:34,003 --> 00:10:40,055
this computer is expecting numbers to be

205
00:10:37,025 --> 00:10:43,124
represented as 32-bit values and the bit

206
00:10:40,082 --> 00:10:45,155
pattern that you get when you do this

207
00:10:44,024 --> 00:10:48,110
multiplication happens to be the

208
00:10:46,055 --> 00:10:52,099
representation of a negative number so

209
00:10:49,001 --> 00:10:54,074
that's a an example of where your normal

210
00:10:52,099 --> 00:10:57,948
expectations about integer arithmetic

211
00:10:54,083 --> 00:11:08,170
may or may not hold on the other hand

212
00:10:58,839 --> 00:11:13,130
there are some places like if I try to

213
00:11:09,007 --> 00:11:15,011
do the same thing multiplying 300 by 400

214
00:11:13,013 --> 00:11:17,051
by 500 by 600 then all of a sudden I

215
00:11:15,074 --> 00:11:19,097
also get a number that clearly is not

216
00:11:17,051 --> 00:11:22,094
what you'd expect because the same thing

217
00:11:19,097 --> 00:11:23,192
has happened I've gotten an overflow it

218
00:11:22,094 --> 00:11:25,178
happens that it's overflowed to a value

219
00:11:24,092 --> 00:11:28,139
that's positive not negative but it

220
00:11:26,078 --> 00:11:31,133
still is obviously not the integer

221
00:11:29,039 --> 00:11:35,045
product of those four numbers on the

222
00:11:32,033 --> 00:11:36,842
other hand one thing you'll find is even

223
00:11:35,045 --> 00:11:42,116
though this arithmetic is now

224
00:11:37,139 --> 00:11:46,181
not a normal sort of integer arithmetic

225
00:11:43,016 --> 00:11:51,295
it actually has some well-behaved

226
00:11:46,559 --> 00:11:50,647
properties so for example if you look at

227
00:11:53,149 --> 00:11:58,208
what I've done is I just moved the 300

228
00:11:56,369 --> 00:12:00,446
around from the beginning of the product

229
00:11:58,739 --> 00:12:02,783
to the end of the product and so now if

230
00:12:01,139 --> 00:12:05,150
you think about how associativity and

231
00:12:03,179 --> 00:12:07,181
community works I'm basically

232
00:12:05,249 --> 00:12:09,287
multiplying these four numbers in a

233
00:12:07,199 --> 00:12:13,350
different order but what you see is you

234
00:12:09,629 --> 00:12:14,696
get the same funny-looking result no

235
00:12:13,035 --> 00:12:16,122
matter how you do it so what you can say

236
00:12:15,299 --> 00:12:18,397
from this is integer arithmetic is

237
00:12:17,022 --> 00:12:21,611
commutative and associative so it obeys

238
00:12:19,279 --> 00:12:22,295
some of the conventional mathematical

239
00:12:21,809 --> 00:12:24,884
properties

240
00:12:22,439 --> 00:12:33,476
it just isn't what you'd expect it to be

241
00:12:25,559 --> 00:12:43,040
it's not a a normal sort of mathematical

242
00:12:33,809 --> 00:12:43,040
integer arithmetic so the cartoon here

243
00:12:43,309 --> 00:12:51,373
shows an example that's a similar

244
00:12:47,006 --> 00:12:51,355
possibility we get to it

245
00:12:57,098 --> 00:13:03,193
oh I guess it comes at the end I don't

246
00:13:02,009 --> 00:13:07,073
know the next question is is a addition

247
00:13:04,093 --> 00:13:09,119
associative right can you order the

248
00:13:07,073 --> 00:13:11,150
numbers and then see probably might have

249
00:13:10,019 --> 00:13:14,054
figured bolted and the integer

250
00:13:12,005 --> 00:13:17,021
arithmetic even though as this potential

251
00:13:14,054 --> 00:13:20,126
for overflow it is associative and it's

252
00:13:17,066 --> 00:13:24,074
commutative too but for floats it's not

253
00:13:21,026 --> 00:13:26,042
really quite the same because the range

254
00:13:24,074 --> 00:13:28,118
of values you can get in floating

255
00:13:26,042 --> 00:13:31,070
pointers so extreme that some numbers

256
00:13:29,018 --> 00:13:33,026
kind of disappear on you so the example

257
00:13:31,007 --> 00:13:36,041
I'll show without having to use a

258
00:13:33,098 --> 00:13:37,184
computer to do it is if you take a big

259
00:13:37,004 --> 00:13:41,009
number and subtract it from itself

260
00:13:38,084 --> 00:13:46,165
you'll get zero so if you add that to

261
00:13:41,054 --> 00:13:50,077
3.14 you'll get 3.14 but if you take

262
00:13:47,065 --> 00:13:54,101
those two numbers and you reorder the

263
00:13:50,077 --> 00:13:57,101
how you combine them so that that 3.14

264
00:13:55,001 --> 00:14:00,020
compared to a minus 10 to the 20th is so

265
00:13:58,001 --> 00:14:04,088
insignificant that that result gets

266
00:14:00,002 --> 00:14:06,098
turned into minus 10 to the 20th and you

267
00:14:04,088 --> 00:14:08,096
add that to one 10 to the 20th and you

268
00:14:07,016 --> 00:14:15,071
end up with zero so it's not associative

269
00:14:09,068 --> 00:14:17,114
and so what you see is the both these

270
00:14:15,071 --> 00:14:19,130
number systems have some peculiarities

271
00:14:18,014 --> 00:14:22,016
and it all comes down to the fact that

272
00:14:20,003 --> 00:14:24,041
they use finite representations of

273
00:14:22,016 --> 00:14:27,113
things that are potentially infinite in

274
00:14:24,068 --> 00:14:30,101
their expanse and so there's some

275
00:14:28,013 --> 00:14:33,065
compromises in how those work and what

276
00:14:31,001 --> 00:14:36,008
the compromise is you can overflow an

277
00:14:33,065 --> 00:14:37,154
integer and run out of room and in

278
00:14:36,071 --> 00:14:39,146
floating point numbers you have roundoff

279
00:14:38,054 --> 00:14:42,122
problems where you should have drop the

280
00:14:40,046 --> 00:14:45,053
digits that are significant you can also

281
00:14:43,022 --> 00:14:49,073
overflow floating points but the more

282
00:14:45,053 --> 00:14:51,086
common problem is round of so this is

283
00:14:49,073 --> 00:14:53,099
shown in this cartoon this idea of

284
00:14:51,086 --> 00:14:56,117
overflow of somebody counting sheep

285
00:14:53,099 --> 00:14:59,116
which in the u.s. is in English language

286
00:14:57,017 --> 00:15:05,066
at least a way to fall asleep and when

287
00:15:00,016 --> 00:15:09,059
he or she goes from 32,767 and then

288
00:15:05,066 --> 00:15:10,151
increment set by one gets minus 32,768

289
00:15:09,059 --> 00:15:13,064
and we'll see

290
00:15:11,051 --> 00:15:16,067
exactly why that happens but basically

291
00:15:13,064 --> 00:15:18,065
the numbers are going up to the largest

292
00:15:16,067 --> 00:15:19,118
value can represent and then when it

293
00:15:18,074 --> 00:15:25,169
goes one more it becomes a negative

294
00:15:20,018 --> 00:15:29,084
number so these are really important

295
00:15:26,069 --> 00:15:31,096
under things to understand I mean 90% of

296
00:15:29,084 --> 00:15:33,128
the time maybe you can just get by

297
00:15:31,096 --> 00:15:35,117
writing programs and not worrying about

298
00:15:34,028 --> 00:15:39,080
whether your numbers are going to exceed

299
00:15:36,017 --> 00:15:41,072
their possible range but they sometimes

300
00:15:39,008 --> 00:15:43,079
when this could be really important if

301
00:15:41,072 --> 00:15:47,072
you're like you know controlling a

302
00:15:44,051 --> 00:15:50,144
rocket you really don't want the

303
00:15:47,072 --> 00:15:53,150
positive thrust to become negative or

304
00:15:51,044 --> 00:15:56,060
something like that so you can see you

305
00:15:54,005 --> 00:15:58,042
there this could be an important

306
00:15:56,006 --> 00:16:00,083
consideration similarly there's

307
00:15:58,087 --> 00:16:02,180
well-known instances of security

308
00:16:01,037 --> 00:16:06,098
vulnerabilities where somebody wrote

309
00:16:03,008 --> 00:16:08,096
code that sort of expected a positive

310
00:16:06,098 --> 00:16:10,142
number in some place and a clever person

311
00:16:09,068 --> 00:16:12,134
figured out if I supply a negative

312
00:16:11,042 --> 00:16:15,077
number I can fool the system and get it

313
00:16:13,034 --> 00:16:17,123
to do bad things so these are the kind

314
00:16:15,077 --> 00:16:18,149
of corner cases that you need to

315
00:16:18,023 --> 00:16:21,074
understand better if you're either

316
00:16:19,049 --> 00:16:22,115
working in programs where it's really

317
00:16:21,074 --> 00:16:25,076
really important that it worked

318
00:16:23,015 --> 00:16:28,064
correctly or you're really worried about

319
00:16:25,076 --> 00:16:30,080
security vulnerabilities anytime you

320
00:16:28,064 --> 00:16:32,122
have possible four corner cases you have

321
00:16:30,008 --> 00:16:34,100
to understand these nuances better a

322
00:16:33,022 --> 00:16:38,024
similarly for floating-point if you're

323
00:16:35,072 --> 00:16:39,146
going to use floating-point for serious

324
00:16:38,042 --> 00:16:43,078
computation whether it's scientific

325
00:16:40,046 --> 00:16:46,061
research or for designing bridges or

326
00:16:43,078 --> 00:16:47,081
nuclear power plants or something you

327
00:16:46,061 --> 00:16:50,150
better understand what the

328
00:16:47,081 --> 00:16:52,136
characteristics are so that's our first

329
00:16:51,005 --> 00:16:55,088
one and we'll spend a couple weeks

330
00:16:53,036 --> 00:16:57,083
talking about numbers and number of

331
00:16:56,033 --> 00:17:00,131
representations and their properties

332
00:16:57,083 --> 00:17:02,141
here the second is we're going to spend

333
00:17:01,031 --> 00:17:05,042
a lot of time in this course learning

334
00:17:03,041 --> 00:17:07,127
about machine level programming meaning

335
00:17:05,042 --> 00:17:10,321
what the instructions are that actually

336
00:17:08,027 --> 00:17:12,089
get executed by the computer and that

337
00:17:10,699 --> 00:17:15,980
can be described in assembly language

338
00:17:12,089 --> 00:17:17,117
which is a text version of it or an

339
00:17:15,098 --> 00:17:20,317
object code which is the actual bit

340
00:17:18,017 --> 00:17:23,806
level binary encoding of instructions

341
00:17:21,199 --> 00:17:24,630
and we'll learn a fair bit about that

342
00:17:23,959 --> 00:17:27,959
and spend

343
00:17:24,063 --> 00:17:30,162
amount of time seeing how code that you

344
00:17:27,959 --> 00:17:33,660
write in aussie gets turned into machine

345
00:17:31,062 --> 00:17:35,145
code and how that gets executed on the

346
00:17:33,066 --> 00:17:37,155
machine one thing I'll say is that

347
00:17:36,045 --> 00:17:40,142
historically courses like this would

348
00:17:38,055 --> 00:17:45,087
teach assembly code by having you write

349
00:17:41,042 --> 00:17:47,064
programs in assembly that do various

350
00:17:45,087 --> 00:17:48,126
things not usually very interesting

351
00:17:47,064 --> 00:17:50,073
because it's a lot of work to write

352
00:17:49,026 --> 00:17:53,031
assembly program this course is much

353
00:17:51,054 --> 00:17:55,101
more about taking the assembly code

354
00:17:53,031 --> 00:17:57,102
that's been generated by a compiler a C

355
00:17:56,001 --> 00:17:59,085
compiler and looking at it and

356
00:17:58,002 --> 00:18:02,028
understanding it that's a different set

357
00:17:59,085 --> 00:18:06,123
of skills than you need to write it on

358
00:18:02,028 --> 00:18:09,111
your own and in particular we're going

359
00:18:07,023 --> 00:18:12,048
to look at the language of of Intel

360
00:18:10,011 --> 00:18:13,017
processors the most recent versions of

361
00:18:12,048 --> 00:18:17,052
them are called

362
00:18:13,017 --> 00:18:20,046
x86 - 64 the 64-bit version of their

363
00:18:17,088 --> 00:18:22,116
instruction set and one thing that's new

364
00:18:20,046 --> 00:18:26,067
in this course compared to previous ones

365
00:18:23,016 --> 00:18:31,025
we used to teach 32-bit stuff this

366
00:18:26,067 --> 00:18:30,125
course is 64 bits all the time

367
00:18:32,039 --> 00:18:37,050
another one that we'll talk about a fair

368
00:18:35,004 --> 00:18:39,101
amount that is really fairly visible to

369
00:18:37,005 --> 00:18:42,012
programmers surprisingly visible is

370
00:18:40,001 --> 00:18:45,093
aspects of the memory system so modern

371
00:18:42,057 --> 00:18:49,059
computers have a very complex layered

372
00:18:45,093 --> 00:18:51,111
memory system to try and give you high

373
00:18:49,077 --> 00:18:54,114
performance in high capacity at the same

374
00:18:52,011 --> 00:18:58,065
time and there's some results of that

375
00:18:55,014 --> 00:19:00,048
system that can mean that if you program

376
00:18:58,065 --> 00:19:02,091
write a program well it might work

377
00:19:00,048 --> 00:19:04,089
really well and if you don't it could

378
00:19:02,091 --> 00:19:06,099
run very poorly because it's not making

379
00:19:04,089 --> 00:19:10,092
use of this hierarchical memory system

380
00:19:06,099 --> 00:19:12,186
so and also there's a lot of bugs that

381
00:19:10,092 --> 00:19:15,093
show up especially in C programs that

382
00:19:13,086 --> 00:19:18,090
have to do with memory referencing

383
00:19:15,093 --> 00:19:20,094
errors and so understanding what those

384
00:19:18,009 --> 00:19:22,011
errors are what their manifestation is

385
00:19:21,003 --> 00:19:26,046
how to prevent them is a big part of the

386
00:19:22,092 --> 00:19:30,135
course so for example if I define a

387
00:19:26,046 --> 00:19:33,105
struct that contains two integer values

388
00:19:31,035 --> 00:19:38,090
a in an array and a double precision

389
00:19:34,005 --> 00:19:38,090
floating point number D and if I

390
00:19:38,091 --> 00:19:43,149
this function f UN you'll see what it

391
00:19:41,789 --> 00:19:47,210
does is it's given an argument I and it

392
00:19:44,049 --> 00:19:52,086
sets the ice element of a to some

393
00:19:47,021 --> 00:19:57,024
strange-looking value so as you know I

394
00:19:52,086 --> 00:20:00,155
should really only be either 0 or 1 with

395
00:19:57,051 --> 00:20:05,720
this code because that's the range of

396
00:20:00,929 --> 00:20:09,390
possible values of this array a but we

397
00:20:06,179 --> 00:20:12,600
can try other things too so in

398
00:20:09,039 --> 00:20:16,040
particular if you run it on either one

399
00:20:12,006 --> 00:20:19,104
or two you'll get what you'd expect that

400
00:20:16,004 --> 00:20:23,061
you assigned a 3.14 to element D of this

401
00:20:20,058 --> 00:20:27,072
structure and when you read it back you

402
00:20:23,097 --> 00:20:32,145
get the same thing and in fact but now

403
00:20:27,072 --> 00:20:34,077
if I set a of two to this number all of

404
00:20:33,045 --> 00:20:37,071
a sudden you'll see that my

405
00:20:35,022 --> 00:20:39,027
floating-point number which seems to

406
00:20:37,071 --> 00:20:44,660
have nothing to do with a has changed

407
00:20:39,072 --> 00:20:46,077
and if I do that same thing with I equal

408
00:20:45,299 --> 00:20:51,299
to three you'll see I get a number

409
00:20:46,077 --> 00:20:54,159
that's closer to two then to 3.14 and if

410
00:20:51,299 --> 00:21:03,720
I keep going well nothing much happens

411
00:20:55,059 --> 00:21:06,878
until I hit 6 and then the program

412
00:21:03,072 --> 00:21:09,087
crashes so something interesting is

413
00:21:07,409 --> 00:21:12,497
going on here at least something quirky

414
00:21:09,087 --> 00:21:15,626
is going on and the reason is again it

415
00:21:13,289 --> 00:21:19,289
has to do with how data is laid out in

416
00:21:16,409 --> 00:21:22,770
memory and how its accessed and one of

417
00:21:19,289 --> 00:21:24,630
the features of C and C++ is it doesn't

418
00:21:22,077 --> 00:21:27,162
do any bounds checking on a race it will

419
00:21:24,063 --> 00:21:31,107
happily let you reference element number

420
00:21:28,062 --> 00:21:34,074
5 million of a two element array and not

421
00:21:32,007 --> 00:21:38,076
complain but the operating system might

422
00:21:34,074 --> 00:21:41,123
complain as it did here and it in this

423
00:21:38,076 --> 00:21:43,107
particular structure and we'll see more

424
00:21:41,789 --> 00:21:45,851
about how structures are implemented and

425
00:21:44,007 --> 00:21:49,616
weighed out but basically the two if

426
00:21:46,409 --> 00:21:52,050
each of these blocks in this vertical

427
00:21:49,679 --> 00:21:54,780
chain represents 4 bytes

428
00:21:52,005 --> 00:21:58,053
and so the two elements of a each are 4

429
00:21:54,078 --> 00:22:03,141
bytes D is 8 bytes and then there's some

430
00:21:58,053 --> 00:22:06,074
other stuff in the other bionda that's

431
00:22:04,041 --> 00:22:10,056
not actually in the struct itself

432
00:22:06,074 --> 00:22:13,152
so you'll see that if I reference either

433
00:22:10,056 --> 00:22:17,082
a of 0 or a of 1 then I will just modify

434
00:22:14,052 --> 00:22:19,146
that array is designed but when I'm

435
00:22:17,082 --> 00:22:23,091
calling fun of 2 or front of 3 what I'm

436
00:22:20,046 --> 00:22:26,052
actually doing is altering the the bytes

437
00:22:23,091 --> 00:22:28,098
that encode this number D and that's why

438
00:22:27,006 --> 00:22:31,029
you saw the sort of funny numbers come

439
00:22:28,098 --> 00:22:33,186
out of it and as I go up at some point

440
00:22:31,029 --> 00:22:37,098
when I hit 6 I'm modifying some state of

441
00:22:34,086 --> 00:22:39,144
the program that it's using to kind of

442
00:22:37,098 --> 00:22:42,105
keep things organized most likely how it

443
00:22:40,044 --> 00:22:47,082
keeps track of of allocated memory and

444
00:22:43,068 --> 00:22:49,139
that's causing the program to crash so

445
00:22:47,082 --> 00:22:53,084
this is a pretty good demonstration of a

446
00:22:50,039 --> 00:22:56,100
why programming can drive you crazy

447
00:22:53,084 --> 00:22:59,093
because as you saw it doesn't do balance

448
00:22:57,000 --> 00:23:06,033
checking so it's easy to write code that

449
00:22:59,093 --> 00:23:08,097
does invalid stuff it's also often the

450
00:23:06,033 --> 00:23:11,037
case that you'll cause some problem and

451
00:23:09,033 --> 00:23:13,086
it has a sort of action a distance

452
00:23:11,037 --> 00:23:16,059
feature that you can modify some think

453
00:23:13,086 --> 00:23:17,145
you're modifying some data structure and

454
00:23:16,059 --> 00:23:19,158
what you're doing because of the way

455
00:23:18,045 --> 00:23:21,093
things are organized in memory you're

456
00:23:20,058 --> 00:23:24,075
changing something totally unrelated

457
00:23:21,093 --> 00:23:25,134
somewhere else in the program you'd

458
00:23:24,075 --> 00:23:28,140
imagine they're not just one apart but

459
00:23:26,034 --> 00:23:32,097
they're 10,000 apart and things might

460
00:23:29,004 --> 00:23:35,022
just run fine for hours days or weeks

461
00:23:32,097 --> 00:23:38,139
and then always say at some point that

462
00:23:35,058 --> 00:23:41,064
data that got corrupted a long time ago

463
00:23:39,039 --> 00:23:44,103
gets accessed and something goes wrong

464
00:23:42,018 --> 00:23:46,113
so this can be some of the worst

465
00:23:45,003 --> 00:23:49,011
nightmare debugging nightmares that

466
00:23:47,013 --> 00:23:56,040
exist on earth is to try and figure out

467
00:23:49,083 --> 00:23:57,138
memory referencing herbs so this is

468
00:23:56,004 --> 00:24:01,065
actually one argument not to program in

469
00:23:58,038 --> 00:24:04,122
C or C++ and it's a valid argument I'll

470
00:24:02,001 --> 00:24:06,006
admit but also as a

471
00:24:05,022 --> 00:24:07,113
person who's writing a lot of C

472
00:24:06,051 --> 00:24:09,057
programming you just get more

473
00:24:08,013 --> 00:24:11,109
experienced and you know at times that

474
00:24:10,011 --> 00:24:14,690
you should actually put bounds checking

475
00:24:12,009 --> 00:24:19,013
in your own code and there's also tools

476
00:24:14,789 --> 00:24:22,080
available that will help you sort of of

477
00:24:19,049 --> 00:24:23,978
bulletproof your code so that it will

478
00:24:22,008 --> 00:24:25,107
detect these kind of problems so it's

479
00:24:24,419 --> 00:24:28,320
not like you have to change languages

480
00:24:26,007 --> 00:24:32,019
but it is a particular feature of these

481
00:24:28,032 --> 00:24:33,114
languages and so understanding sort of

482
00:24:32,019 --> 00:24:36,021
the Machine level representation of data

483
00:24:34,014 --> 00:24:38,046
structures and how they work is very

484
00:24:36,021 --> 00:24:40,086
really makes a huge difference in your

485
00:24:38,046 --> 00:24:42,875
ability to deal with these kind of

486
00:24:40,086 --> 00:24:44,121
vulnerabilities and things of ulnar

487
00:24:43,289 --> 00:24:51,450
abilities by the way also from a

488
00:24:45,021 --> 00:24:52,970
security perspective the the fourth sort

489
00:24:51,045 --> 00:24:55,024
of theme we'll cover in the course is

490
00:24:53,159 --> 00:24:59,220
getting performance out of programs

491
00:24:55,429 --> 00:25:00,434
other parts of the curriculum in CS do

492
00:24:59,022 --> 00:25:02,076
much more emphasis on getting the right

493
00:25:00,929 --> 00:25:04,860
algorithm at the right data structure

494
00:25:02,076 --> 00:25:06,132
and that's really well and good it's

495
00:25:04,086 --> 00:25:10,139
important stuff I don't deny it but they

496
00:25:07,032 --> 00:25:13,751
some amount of the sort of low-level

497
00:25:11,039 --> 00:25:16,065
optimization that you need to do that

498
00:25:14,039 --> 00:25:19,140
you need to understand what the system

499
00:25:16,065 --> 00:25:20,073
does what makes it run well what makes

500
00:25:19,014 --> 00:25:24,033
it run for way in order to be able to do

501
00:25:21,045 --> 00:25:29,064
that kind of optimization so the example

502
00:25:24,033 --> 00:25:31,098
we like to use is these two functions do

503
00:25:29,064 --> 00:25:37,213
exactly the same thing in terms of their

504
00:25:31,098 --> 00:25:40,197
their behavior what they do is copy a

505
00:25:37,789 --> 00:25:46,130
matrix or array from called source or

506
00:25:41,097 --> 00:25:51,099
SRC to a destination DST they're both

507
00:25:46,013 --> 00:25:54,057
size to be 2048 rows 2048 columns

508
00:25:51,099 --> 00:25:55,170
two-dimensional arrays and you'll see

509
00:25:54,057 --> 00:25:58,101
that the programs do the obvious thing

510
00:25:56,007 --> 00:26:00,084
you have a nested pair of loops to do

511
00:25:59,001 --> 00:26:04,062
the row and column indices and you just

512
00:26:01,047 --> 00:26:06,506
copy from one source element to a

513
00:26:04,062 --> 00:26:08,160
destination element the only thing

514
00:26:06,929 --> 00:26:14,010
that's different you'll see is that the

515
00:26:09,006 --> 00:26:15,030
two loops their nesting is different the

516
00:26:14,001 --> 00:26:20,046
nesting order is different in one case

517
00:26:15,084 --> 00:26:22,117
I'm going kind of row first

518
00:26:20,046 --> 00:26:24,130
going through all the rows and then the

519
00:26:23,017 --> 00:26:27,055
columns and the other is for any given

520
00:26:25,003 --> 00:26:28,012
row I'm copying all the columns that's

521
00:26:27,055 --> 00:26:31,111
really the only difference between these

522
00:26:29,002 --> 00:26:35,020
two programs but what you'll find if you

523
00:26:32,011 --> 00:26:37,018
run it on a typical system is that that

524
00:26:35,038 --> 00:26:39,073
one is much faster than the other in

525
00:26:37,018 --> 00:26:42,061
this particular machine we ran it on it

526
00:26:39,073 --> 00:26:44,131
was about close to 20 times difference

527
00:26:42,061 --> 00:26:47,137
in performance so something fishy is

528
00:26:45,031 --> 00:26:50,040
going on if the same program that

529
00:26:48,037 --> 00:26:52,135
differs only in this seemingly

530
00:26:50,004 --> 00:26:55,015
insignificant way a way that has no

531
00:26:53,035 --> 00:26:56,128
effect whatsoever on its functionality

532
00:26:55,051 --> 00:27:00,118
can have this much performance

533
00:26:57,028 --> 00:27:04,110
difference and so to understand this you

534
00:27:01,018 --> 00:27:04,110
need to stare at the cover of the book

535
00:27:07,002 --> 00:27:14,071
because basically you're two different

536
00:27:11,053 --> 00:27:16,078
points of this strange-looking picture

537
00:27:14,071 --> 00:27:18,136
that's on your book and since there's no

538
00:27:16,078 --> 00:27:22,150
axes or labels on it it makes no sense

539
00:27:19,036 --> 00:27:25,069
whatsoever but it's there so what you

540
00:27:23,005 --> 00:27:27,019
see is this picture shows four different

541
00:27:25,069 --> 00:27:29,161
memory access patterns and I won't go

542
00:27:27,064 --> 00:27:34,125
into the details of what the throughput

543
00:27:30,061 --> 00:27:37,146
measured in megabytes per second on on a

544
00:27:35,025 --> 00:27:40,078
basically a copying program was and

545
00:27:38,046 --> 00:27:42,100
without going into the details what

546
00:27:40,078 --> 00:27:44,083
you'll see is these two functions sort

547
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:47,053
of sit at different points in this

548
00:27:44,083 --> 00:27:49,090
memory access pattern the one that goes

549
00:27:47,053 --> 00:27:51,091
through row by row is much better than

550
00:27:50,053 --> 00:27:54,148
the one that goes through column by

551
00:27:51,091 --> 00:27:56,143
column and as a result you're getting a

552
00:27:55,048 --> 00:27:59,056
lot better performance that it has to do

553
00:27:57,043 --> 00:28:01,096
with this memory hierarchy and what they

554
00:27:59,056 --> 00:28:04,069
call the cache memories that you're

555
00:28:01,096 --> 00:28:07,165
getting way better performance out of it

556
00:28:04,069 --> 00:28:09,142
in case than the other so that's

557
00:28:08,065 --> 00:28:12,094
explains what the cover of the book is

558
00:28:10,042 --> 00:28:15,118
about and we'll talk about it more later

559
00:28:12,094 --> 00:28:17,107
in the course and then a final part of

560
00:28:16,018 --> 00:28:19,102
the course talks more about not just

561
00:28:18,007 --> 00:28:22,093
getting computers to run little programs

562
00:28:20,002 --> 00:28:25,006
in isolation but getting computers that

563
00:28:22,093 --> 00:28:27,175
talk to each other over networks and

564
00:28:25,042 --> 00:28:30,118
implement services like web servers and

565
00:28:28,075 --> 00:28:32,004
other functions like that which of

566
00:28:31,018 --> 00:28:34,024
course is where

567
00:28:32,679 --> 00:28:36,850
most in the world of computing sits

568
00:28:34,024 --> 00:28:39,663
today it's not just isolated machines

569
00:28:36,085 --> 00:28:40,159
but computers that interact with each

570
00:28:39,879 --> 00:28:43,953
other over the network they're embedded

571
00:28:41,059 --> 00:28:45,070
controllers that are interacting with

572
00:28:44,619 --> 00:28:48,490
the physical world

573
00:28:45,007 --> 00:28:50,011
so really the the world of computers is

574
00:28:48,049 --> 00:28:52,848
a much richer environment and will cover

575
00:28:50,074 --> 00:28:59,373
at least some aspects of that in the

576
00:28:53,289 --> 00:29:01,314
final part of this course so as I

577
00:29:00,039 --> 00:29:03,051
mentioned the other feature of this

578
00:29:01,539 --> 00:29:05,230
course is it will get you ready for

579
00:29:03,159 --> 00:29:08,196
other systems courses you might take it

580
00:29:05,023 --> 00:29:11,172
CMU and here we listed actually a subset

581
00:29:08,529 --> 00:29:13,551
of the courses at the university that

582
00:29:11,379 --> 00:29:16,404
require this course is a prerequisite

583
00:29:13,749 --> 00:29:20,110
and they're mostly in computer science

584
00:29:16,629 --> 00:29:24,630
and ECE but you'll see it's quite a

585
00:29:20,011 --> 00:29:28,020
range of of different courses and each

586
00:29:24,639 --> 00:29:30,651
of them builds on say one or multiple

587
00:29:28,119 --> 00:29:34,125
aspects of the material you learn in the

588
00:29:30,759 --> 00:29:36,100
course so the reason why we make

589
00:29:34,179 --> 00:29:39,190
everyone take this course including

590
00:29:36,001 --> 00:29:41,070
incoming Master students is that all

591
00:29:39,019 --> 00:29:43,638
these other courses at the University

592
00:29:41,169 --> 00:29:46,227
have come to rely on students being

593
00:29:43,809 --> 00:29:50,230
familiar and having done the work of two

594
00:29:46,749 --> 00:29:52,450
thirteen or five thirteen as a

595
00:29:50,023 --> 00:29:55,062
prerequisite and they can build on that

596
00:29:52,045 --> 00:29:56,134
material and sort of cover more ground

597
00:29:55,269 --> 00:29:59,200
as a result rather than having to do

598
00:29:57,034 --> 00:30:01,743
what would otherwise be somewhat

599
00:29:59,002 --> 00:30:03,711
remedial work on it and in fact one of

600
00:30:02,049 --> 00:30:06,051
the part of the genesis of this course

601
00:30:03,909 --> 00:30:10,450
was the people who taught the operating

602
00:30:06,249 --> 00:30:11,830
system course a 410 sort of complained

603
00:30:10,045 --> 00:30:12,121
that they were spending too much time at

604
00:30:11,083 --> 00:30:14,095
the beginning of the course talking

605
00:30:13,021 --> 00:30:18,600
about some very basics of machine

606
00:30:14,095 --> 00:30:20,134
programming and and Dave and I said oh

607
00:30:18,789 --> 00:30:24,852
well we can cover that so that was part

608
00:30:21,034 --> 00:30:27,213
of what got this course started and as I

609
00:30:25,419 --> 00:30:29,427
mentioned that the course has a sort of

610
00:30:27,519 --> 00:30:32,523
perspective that's very different from

611
00:30:29,499 --> 00:30:34,575
traditional systems courses most systems

612
00:30:32,559 --> 00:30:37,584
courses including that whole array saw

613
00:30:35,259 --> 00:30:40,360
there were about how do I build some

614
00:30:37,809 --> 00:30:42,700
particular feature how do i implement an

615
00:30:40,036 --> 00:30:45,109
operating system how do I design a

616
00:30:42,007 --> 00:30:47,011
pipeline microprocessor

617
00:30:46,009 --> 00:30:50,035
and don't it's all important stuff to

618
00:30:48,001 --> 00:30:52,009
know we really want the people who are

619
00:30:50,035 --> 00:30:54,594
out there building operating systems and

620
00:30:52,009 --> 00:30:57,016
designing microprocessors to have

621
00:30:54,909 --> 00:30:59,860
learned how to do it on the other hand

622
00:30:57,097 --> 00:31:00,151
is a way to sort of get new into this

623
00:30:59,086 --> 00:31:03,115
and get the introduction and get the

624
00:31:01,051 --> 00:31:04,147
experience we find it more useful to

625
00:31:04,015 --> 00:31:11,024
take what we call a programmers

626
00:31:05,047 --> 00:31:14,089
perspective meaning understanding of

627
00:31:11,159 --> 00:31:17,080
what you as a person who sits in front

628
00:31:14,089 --> 00:31:18,124
of a computer screen and types code I

629
00:31:17,008 --> 00:31:21,013
need to know about that machine you're

630
00:31:19,024 --> 00:31:24,085
typing code for in order to be effective

631
00:31:21,058 --> 00:31:25,144
at doing it as opposed to somebody who

632
00:31:24,085 --> 00:31:30,384
some day going to be designing the

633
00:31:26,044 --> 00:31:32,053
actual machine itself so that by taking

634
00:31:31,149 --> 00:31:35,500
that perspective it gives you sort of an

635
00:31:33,034 --> 00:31:36,109
understanding so now when you go off to

636
00:31:35,005 --> 00:31:38,904
implement it you'll actually know what

637
00:31:37,009 --> 00:31:41,107
these features are and why it's

638
00:31:39,399 --> 00:31:44,500
important to implement them well but

639
00:31:42,007 --> 00:31:47,346
also that by doing this programmers

640
00:31:44,005 --> 00:31:48,924
perspective it lets you right away get

641
00:31:47,409 --> 00:31:51,370
tools that you can use in other places

642
00:31:49,419 --> 00:31:53,493
where you're writing programs are doing

643
00:31:51,037 --> 00:31:56,110
anything related to it and be more

644
00:31:54,159 --> 00:31:59,234
effective at that so this programmers

645
00:31:57,001 --> 00:32:03,025
perspective really gives this dual

646
00:31:59,909 --> 00:32:05,590
benefit to it that we feel is very

647
00:32:03,034 --> 00:32:07,060
useful and students have taken the

648
00:32:05,059 --> 00:32:10,518
course in the past have expressed that

649
00:32:07,006 --> 00:32:12,103
as well so as I mentioned the we have

650
00:32:11,049 --> 00:32:17,073
two instructors for the course

651
00:32:13,057 --> 00:32:20,526
and they also happen to be authors and

652
00:32:17,289 --> 00:32:23,860
the longest we've probably taught this

653
00:32:21,039 --> 00:32:25,960
course more than anyone else but it's

654
00:32:23,086 --> 00:32:29,119
also taught by other people on campus as

655
00:32:25,096 --> 00:32:33,145
well so what I'm going to do now is hand

656
00:32:30,019 --> 00:32:36,082
my pair of microphones over two days all

657
00:32:34,045 --> 00:32:38,754
right welcome good afternoon it's great

658
00:32:36,082 --> 00:32:41,161
to see you my name is Dave Wilhelm Hren

659
00:32:39,159 --> 00:32:45,190
and I'm just delighted to have the

660
00:32:42,061 --> 00:32:51,870
opportunity to be one of your

661
00:32:45,019 --> 00:32:55,045
instructors this term this course is one

662
00:32:52,419 --> 00:32:56,424
of the reason I'm so excited to be

663
00:32:55,045 --> 00:32:57,120
teaching this course I mean I just love

664
00:32:56,919 --> 00:33:00,938
this course and

665
00:32:58,002 --> 00:33:02,791
the real reason is the the opportunity

666
00:33:01,109 --> 00:33:05,174
of represents to have an impact on

667
00:33:02,989 --> 00:33:06,997
people's lives we really believe that

668
00:33:05,759 --> 00:33:10,760
the material you learned this semester

669
00:33:07,789 --> 00:33:12,821
can help a really positive and

670
00:33:10,769 --> 00:33:15,773
long-lasting impact on on your careers

671
00:33:13,109 --> 00:33:19,124
and it'll help you not only with your

672
00:33:16,169 --> 00:33:23,195
future classes but also future positions

673
00:33:19,259 --> 00:33:24,320
you have and I hear this from people all

674
00:33:23,429 --> 00:33:27,497
all the time

675
00:33:24,869 --> 00:33:29,897
former CMU students and students around

676
00:33:28,109 --> 00:33:32,188
the world to have taken the equivalent

677
00:33:30,149 --> 00:33:36,170
of 213 at their schools

678
00:33:32,899 --> 00:33:38,460
even a couple years ago we were

679
00:33:36,359 --> 00:33:41,100
interviewing a faculty member finished

680
00:33:38,046 --> 00:33:44,046
tenure-track faculty member who went to

681
00:33:41,001 --> 00:33:45,087
did his undergrad at CMU and then went

682
00:33:44,046 --> 00:33:49,119
off to Stanford got his PhD at Stanford

683
00:33:45,096 --> 00:33:53,675
and was coming back to you know join the

684
00:33:50,019 --> 00:33:56,498
faculty and he told me that 213 changed

685
00:33:54,539 --> 00:33:57,544
his life in our interview and I don't

686
00:33:56,669 --> 00:34:01,440
know if he was trying to butter me up

687
00:33:58,039 --> 00:34:03,044
but I I think I believe him he he said

688
00:34:01,044 --> 00:34:05,243
it changed his whole life in the sense

689
00:34:03,539 --> 00:34:07,574
that it gave him a research direction

690
00:34:05,639 --> 00:34:09,680
you know he didn't really know what what

691
00:34:07,889 --> 00:34:11,891
he knew it kind of like computer science

692
00:34:10,049 --> 00:34:15,960
but it didn't really know what direction

693
00:34:12,089 --> 00:34:18,092
to go and and after he took to 13 he

694
00:34:15,096 --> 00:34:21,099
knew they wanted to to do his word was

695
00:34:18,389 --> 00:34:23,940
life's work in systems now it was just

696
00:34:21,099 --> 00:34:25,508
remarkable right to come back and have

697
00:34:23,094 --> 00:34:27,293
we ended up actually hiring him and he

698
00:34:26,399 --> 00:34:29,760
told me that everybody in his lab at

699
00:34:28,139 --> 00:34:32,040
Stanford all of the grad students had a

700
00:34:29,076 --> 00:34:33,099
copy of a book on their desk front and

701
00:34:32,004 --> 00:34:38,333
they were from all over you know all

702
00:34:33,099 --> 00:34:40,146
different schools and so I mean I even I

703
00:34:38,369 --> 00:34:43,376
was in a bookstore in Beijing a couple

704
00:34:41,046 --> 00:34:46,715
years ago right outside the PKU campus

705
00:34:44,069 --> 00:34:48,101
and I was up on the fifth floor trying

706
00:34:47,129 --> 00:34:52,740
to see if I could find a copy of the

707
00:34:48,389 --> 00:34:55,406
textbook and I found the English version

708
00:34:52,074 --> 00:34:58,423
in one aisle and then a couple aisles

709
00:34:55,559 --> 00:35:01,440
over I found the Chinese version I was

710
00:34:59,089 --> 00:35:04,091
going through the Chinese version and

711
00:35:01,044 --> 00:35:06,090
the sky tapped me on my shoulder and I

712
00:35:04,109 --> 00:35:08,520
turned around he says oh man that that

713
00:35:06,009 --> 00:35:11,428
book is really good you should the

714
00:35:08,052 --> 00:35:11,851
English version is two aisles over

715
00:35:12,086 --> 00:35:19,143
and I mean it just blew me away to be to

716
00:35:17,097 --> 00:35:21,138
be in the head of someone like halfway

717
00:35:20,043 --> 00:35:25,056
around the world it was just that it was

718
00:35:22,038 --> 00:35:27,081
just one of those moments and so I'm I'm

719
00:35:25,056 --> 00:35:29,061
not trying to boast I'm just trying what

720
00:35:27,081 --> 00:35:31,110
I want I want to give you the sense of

721
00:35:29,061 --> 00:35:35,061
what it what an opportunity this course

722
00:35:32,001 --> 00:35:37,086
represents for for Randi and I to to

723
00:35:35,061 --> 00:35:43,095
have what we hope will be a really

724
00:35:37,095 --> 00:35:47,127
positive impact on on your lives so let

725
00:35:43,095 --> 00:35:50,130
me we have kind of a kind of a funny

726
00:35:48,027 --> 00:35:52,101
organization for the course to it in

727
00:35:51,003 --> 00:35:54,096
response to that just that the

728
00:35:53,001 --> 00:35:57,057
tremendous demand we have we found that

729
00:35:55,023 --> 00:36:00,024
we have for it so there's there's

730
00:35:57,057 --> 00:36:02,064
actually three course numbers but it's

731
00:36:00,033 --> 00:36:06,045
all the same course okay it's identical

732
00:36:02,064 --> 00:36:10,155
course 513 15 513 is for our master

733
00:36:06,045 --> 00:36:12,138
students and the 513 513 doesn't have a

734
00:36:11,055 --> 00:36:14,109
formal lecture so there's no seats

735
00:36:13,038 --> 00:36:17,527
assigned to it

736
00:36:15,009 --> 00:36:20,010
instead we'll videotape the lectures and

737
00:36:17,869 --> 00:36:22,920
we'll make those available on the course

738
00:36:20,001 --> 00:36:25,017
web web page for our for our graduate

739
00:36:22,092 --> 00:36:28,125
students and the reason we do this is

740
00:36:25,026 --> 00:36:30,875
just because in the past well we we

741
00:36:29,025 --> 00:36:32,097
didn't have enough seats for everyone

742
00:36:31,109 --> 00:36:35,630
and there would be cases where there

743
00:36:32,097 --> 00:36:37,140
might be a hundred 150

744
00:36:35,063 --> 00:36:38,160
Master students on the waitlist they

745
00:36:38,004 --> 00:36:41,213
wouldn't be able to get into the course

746
00:36:39,006 --> 00:36:42,069
and we we didn't really want that

747
00:36:41,609 --> 00:36:46,440
because they need this course for to

748
00:36:43,023 --> 00:36:48,120
take other courses so that's the reason

749
00:36:46,044 --> 00:36:52,125
why we have this this sort of does not

750
00:36:49,002 --> 00:36:55,029
meet version of 213 is 513 because we

751
00:36:53,025 --> 00:36:56,106
can admit as many all the master's

752
00:36:55,047 --> 00:37:01,110
students that that need to take the

753
00:36:57,006 --> 00:37:04,098
course now 15 to 13 and 18 to 13 or are

754
00:37:02,001 --> 00:37:12,042
for undergraduates in computer science

755
00:37:04,098 --> 00:37:13,131
and ECE respectively okay and the

756
00:37:12,051 --> 00:37:16,910
undergraduates will go to lectures and

757
00:37:14,031 --> 00:37:18,093
recitations okay in person graduate

758
00:37:17,369 --> 00:37:21,210
students will watch videotapes of those

759
00:37:18,093 --> 00:37:21,180
but otherwise yes

760
00:37:21,021 --> 00:37:26,094
for those videotapes will they be

761
00:37:22,008 --> 00:37:31,070
available Kamal yeah we're making them

762
00:37:26,094 --> 00:37:33,150
available to everyone actually sorry and

763
00:37:32,042 --> 00:37:40,241
lecture slides as well everything is

764
00:37:34,005 --> 00:37:46,023
available on the course web page so so

765
00:37:40,619 --> 00:37:50,490
you'll be doing the all of students will

766
00:37:46,068 --> 00:37:53,073
have equal access to office hours the

767
00:37:50,049 --> 00:37:56,103
staff mailing list and everybody does

768
00:37:53,073 --> 00:37:58,092
the same labs and the same exams okay so

769
00:37:57,003 --> 00:38:00,092
it's just a question it's just a matter

770
00:37:58,092 --> 00:38:00,180
of whether you're good a lecture in

771
00:38:00,119 --> 00:38:04,800
person or if you're watching on video in

772
00:38:01,008 --> 00:38:05,067
fact if you know since it's available to

773
00:38:04,008 --> 00:38:07,547
everybody if you miss lecture it'll be

774
00:38:06,039 --> 00:38:09,488
there on the web page and you can catch

775
00:38:08,339 --> 00:38:11,730
up which I know you'll probably do

776
00:38:09,839 --> 00:38:13,862
actually I know most of you will never

777
00:38:11,073 --> 00:38:17,102
miss class right but the few of you who

778
00:38:14,069 --> 00:38:18,020
do you'll be able to watch the video

779
00:38:18,008 --> 00:38:24,027
okay all right this is the one part I

780
00:38:23,025 --> 00:38:28,094
list the part I hate

781
00:38:24,099 --> 00:38:29,918
I love teaching that this is this is the

782
00:38:28,319 --> 00:38:33,000
one part teaching that none of us really

783
00:38:30,809 --> 00:38:37,440
like but we have to talk about it and

784
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:42,599
that's academic integrity if you're new

785
00:38:37,044 --> 00:38:43,101
on campus coming from a international

786
00:38:42,599 --> 00:38:49,200
school if you're an international

787
00:38:44,001 --> 00:38:52,310
student new on campus there might be

788
00:38:49,002 --> 00:38:55,421
different notions of academic integrity

789
00:38:52,319 --> 00:38:58,373
and different notions of cheating at

790
00:38:55,619 --> 00:39:01,770
your undergraduate school or your old

791
00:38:58,859 --> 00:39:03,884
school so if you're new on campus pay

792
00:39:01,077 --> 00:39:05,148
very close attention to this because at

793
00:39:04,109 --> 00:39:11,010
Carnegie Mellon we take academic

794
00:39:06,048 --> 00:39:14,115
integrity very seriously okay it's not a

795
00:39:11,001 --> 00:39:17,050
wink wink nod nod we're very serious

796
00:39:15,015 --> 00:39:20,204
about it

797
00:39:17,059 --> 00:39:21,660
and we want you we want everybody doing

798
00:39:20,339 --> 00:39:27,210
their own work to preserve the integrity

799
00:39:21,066 --> 00:39:30,245
of the courses so what exactly is

800
00:39:27,021 --> 00:39:34,076
cheating so if you share code with

801
00:39:30,839 --> 00:39:37,550
anybody either copying

802
00:39:34,076 --> 00:39:38,090
retyping looking at somebody's code like

803
00:39:37,055 --> 00:39:42,067
if you look at somebody's code on the

804
00:39:38,009 --> 00:39:47,036
screen or if you give somebody a file

805
00:39:42,067 --> 00:39:53,093
all of those all of those examples of

806
00:39:48,017 --> 00:39:55,106
sharing are cheating if if you describe

807
00:39:53,093 --> 00:39:57,139
your code like line by line to somebody

808
00:39:56,006 --> 00:39:58,039
that's cheating

809
00:39:58,081 --> 00:40:05,125
if you coach somebody line by line

810
00:40:02,008 --> 00:40:05,053
that's cheating

811
00:40:06,007 --> 00:40:12,029
searching the web for solutions just the

812
00:40:09,044 --> 00:40:15,047
act of searching is cheating and this is

813
00:40:12,092 --> 00:40:18,107
a this is a real problem for us in

814
00:40:15,047 --> 00:40:22,076
particular because the course is offered

815
00:40:19,007 --> 00:40:25,016
all around the world and people either

816
00:40:22,076 --> 00:40:26,093
maliciously or or sometimes just they're

817
00:40:25,016 --> 00:40:28,091
proud of their work and they post it you

818
00:40:26,093 --> 00:40:33,134
know for employers on like public github

819
00:40:28,091 --> 00:40:36,146
sites so it's it might be tempting to to

820
00:40:34,034 --> 00:40:39,070
search for these solutions but even the

821
00:40:37,046 --> 00:40:41,114
act of searching is cheating and

822
00:40:39,007 --> 00:40:42,059
definitely if you find some a solution

823
00:40:42,014 --> 00:40:46,025
in and use it

824
00:40:43,022 --> 00:40:49,061
that's cheating even if you modify it

825
00:40:46,025 --> 00:40:51,026
afterwards and I just want you to

826
00:40:49,061 --> 00:40:53,078
remember I can I know how to use Google

827
00:40:51,026 --> 00:41:02,029
just as well as anybody else right so I

828
00:40:53,078 --> 00:41:04,112
I can search for solutions too so

829
00:41:02,056 --> 00:41:06,140
copying code you know you might be

830
00:41:05,012 --> 00:41:10,019
tempted you might be tempted to copy

831
00:41:07,004 --> 00:41:12,086
code from someone who took the class you

832
00:41:10,019 --> 00:41:15,110
know in a previous semester don't do it

833
00:41:13,022 --> 00:41:18,023
that's that's cheating - now what's not

834
00:41:16,001 --> 00:41:20,093
cheating so you can you can help each

835
00:41:18,032 --> 00:41:22,085
other use tools you know somebody's

836
00:41:21,002 --> 00:41:27,002
having trouble using gdb or you know

837
00:41:22,085 --> 00:41:28,133
they have questions about how to run use

838
00:41:27,002 --> 00:41:32,027
a text editor that stuff's all great you

839
00:41:29,033 --> 00:41:33,122
can help each other out using the tools

840
00:41:32,027 --> 00:41:37,121
how to log into the shark machines all

841
00:41:34,022 --> 00:41:39,065
of that kind of stuff and you can help

842
00:41:38,021 --> 00:41:41,024
you can discuss sort of high-level

843
00:41:39,065 --> 00:41:43,102
design issues and that's probably a good

844
00:41:41,051 --> 00:41:43,102
idea yes

845
00:41:45,096 --> 00:41:55,117
yeah yeah did you take it a previous

846
00:41:48,007 --> 00:41:57,013
semester oh okay yeah the question was

847
00:41:56,017 --> 00:41:59,080
if you took it in a previous semester

848
00:41:57,076 --> 00:42:04,135
can use your your work and the answer is

849
00:41:59,008 --> 00:42:06,052
yes so it you can also talk to each

850
00:42:05,035 --> 00:42:10,039
other about high level you know design

851
00:42:07,024 --> 00:42:14,068
issues you know how are you are using an

852
00:42:10,039 --> 00:42:16,045
explicit list or using a segregated list

853
00:42:14,068 --> 00:42:19,150
for your Malik lab okay that kind of

854
00:42:16,099 --> 00:42:24,130
stuff is is is okay okay high level okay

855
00:42:20,005 --> 00:42:28,054
low level not okay and basically what we

856
00:42:25,003 --> 00:42:30,070
want you to write your own code this is

857
00:42:28,099 --> 00:42:31,165
not you know it's kind of a cut and

858
00:42:30,097 --> 00:42:35,155
paste world these days right you look

859
00:42:32,065 --> 00:42:39,118
stuff up on Google's Stack Overflow you

860
00:42:36,055 --> 00:42:43,123
cut and paste it but that's not that's

861
00:42:40,018 --> 00:42:45,085
not the way we do it here we want you to

862
00:42:44,023 --> 00:42:48,112
do the work yourself we want you to

863
00:42:45,085 --> 00:42:52,119
enjoy the experience of figuring things

864
00:42:49,012 --> 00:42:53,019
out and learning how to solve problems

865
00:42:54,018 --> 00:43:01,033
now the consequences for cheating

866
00:42:56,067 --> 00:43:02,146
there's a single sanction if you're

867
00:43:01,033 --> 00:43:04,116
caught cheating you'll you'll be

868
00:43:03,046 --> 00:43:08,065
expelled from the course with an R

869
00:43:05,016 --> 00:43:11,017
there's no exceptions all right if you

870
00:43:08,065 --> 00:43:17,071
drop the course we'll just reinstate you

871
00:43:11,017 --> 00:43:22,021
and then flunk you it's really a it's a

872
00:43:18,025 --> 00:43:25,036
very serious very serious penalty

873
00:43:22,057 --> 00:43:31,090
because we just take it we take it so

874
00:43:25,036 --> 00:43:34,122
seriously at at sub and it's just it's

875
00:43:31,009 --> 00:43:34,041
just something we don't want you to do

876
00:43:35,031 --> 00:43:49,120
we have amazing tools to detect code

877
00:43:39,067 --> 00:43:53,164
plagiarism we have amazing tools to

878
00:43:50,002 --> 00:43:59,023
detect plagiarism that are that are

879
00:43:54,064 --> 00:44:00,138
resilient to renaming reformatting they

880
00:43:59,041 --> 00:44:07,120
operate at a very deep syntactic level

881
00:44:01,038 --> 00:44:10,054
and so just please please don't do it we

882
00:44:08,002 --> 00:44:12,075
have I think 18 TAS will have office

883
00:44:10,054 --> 00:44:15,055
hours almost every day of the week

884
00:44:12,093 --> 00:44:21,127
there's plenty of opportunities and ways

885
00:44:15,055 --> 00:44:23,122
to get help start early if you get stuck

886
00:44:22,027 --> 00:44:29,028
start early enough so that you get stuck

887
00:44:24,022 --> 00:44:31,069
you can go ask for help we have the

888
00:44:29,028 --> 00:44:32,110
automatic extensions built-in if you

889
00:44:31,069 --> 00:44:36,115
need more time I'll talk about that

890
00:44:33,001 --> 00:44:42,007
later form of grace days but please

891
00:44:37,015 --> 00:44:45,043
please whatever you do don't cheat it's

892
00:44:42,007 --> 00:44:48,013
just tragic when it happens last last

893
00:44:45,043 --> 00:44:51,067
fall 25 students were expelled from the

894
00:44:48,076 --> 00:44:52,084
course some were expelled from the

895
00:44:51,067 --> 00:44:57,070
university because it was a second

896
00:44:53,056 --> 00:44:59,056
offense many were sent home I talked to

897
00:44:57,007 --> 00:45:02,065
students who were like the only person

898
00:44:59,056 --> 00:45:05,056
in their family to go to college the

899
00:45:03,028 --> 00:45:07,123
only person in their village to go to

900
00:45:05,056 --> 00:45:09,124
college and they were going home without

901
00:45:08,023 --> 00:45:13,066
without a degree and it's just tragic

902
00:45:10,024 --> 00:45:17,070
it's just so please please please don't

903
00:45:13,066 --> 00:45:20,121
do it do your own work and it'll be a

904
00:45:17,007 --> 00:45:20,058
wonderful experience

905
00:45:22,052 --> 00:45:26,066
Randy mentioned the the textbook is

906
00:45:24,061 --> 00:45:30,092
computer systems the programmers

907
00:45:26,066 --> 00:45:33,071
perspective third edition you can

908
00:45:30,092 --> 00:45:35,144
there's a whole bunch of supporting

909
00:45:33,071 --> 00:45:40,103
material on the on the books website at

910
00:45:36,044 --> 00:45:42,083
CFA PT dot C s CMU edu and as Randy

911
00:45:41,003 --> 00:45:44,042
mentioned this this book really matters

912
00:45:42,083 --> 00:45:47,111
for the course because actually the book

913
00:45:44,042 --> 00:45:49,058
came out of the course right so the book

914
00:45:48,011 --> 00:45:53,075
is the course of course that's the book

915
00:45:49,058 --> 00:45:55,061
on and so it'll it'll really help you

916
00:45:53,075 --> 00:45:56,144
love it the labs that we do come

917
00:45:55,061 --> 00:45:59,063
directly from material that we discuss

918
00:45:57,044 --> 00:46:00,116
in the book so what I would encourage

919
00:45:59,063 --> 00:46:02,111
all of you to do and I'm not sure if

920
00:46:01,016 --> 00:46:04,103
anybody has ever taken this advice but I

921
00:46:03,011 --> 00:46:08,036
say it every year anyway because I

922
00:46:05,003 --> 00:46:10,070
believe it but I think a really good

923
00:46:08,036 --> 00:46:12,071
strategy for studying and preparing for

924
00:46:10,007 --> 00:46:16,070
this course would be to read each

925
00:46:12,071 --> 00:46:19,154
chapter three times okay read it three

926
00:46:17,033 --> 00:46:21,038
times work the practice problem so we

927
00:46:20,054 --> 00:46:23,069
have littered throughout the book or

928
00:46:21,083 --> 00:46:25,109
practice problems with solutions at the

929
00:46:23,069 --> 00:46:27,080
end of the the end of the chapter and

930
00:46:26,009 --> 00:46:29,072
these practice problems are like little

931
00:46:27,008 --> 00:46:32,030
sort of bite-size morsels just to kind

932
00:46:29,072 --> 00:46:34,073
of just to kind of check your kind of

933
00:46:33,002 --> 00:46:37,046
sanity check of your understanding of

934
00:46:34,082 --> 00:46:38,096
the material so I think if you've read

935
00:46:37,046 --> 00:46:40,073
this if you read the book

936
00:46:38,096 --> 00:46:41,153
each chapter three times and work the

937
00:46:40,073 --> 00:46:45,155
practice problems you it that would be

938
00:46:42,053 --> 00:46:49,100
an excellent way to go through the

939
00:46:46,055 --> 00:46:52,079
semester and prepare the other book we

940
00:46:50,000 --> 00:46:58,058
use is the Colonel Hannon Richie's

941
00:46:52,079 --> 00:46:58,172
classic C programming book I think this

942
00:46:58,058 --> 00:47:02,093
is still this was written a long time

943
00:46:59,072 --> 00:47:04,141
ago it's still the best book around I

944
00:47:02,093 --> 00:47:07,130
think for C it's a it's a beautiful

945
00:47:05,041 --> 00:47:10,052
example of technical writing it was one

946
00:47:08,003 --> 00:47:12,032
of the inspirations I used when I was

947
00:47:10,052 --> 00:47:15,098
writing the book you know I tried to

948
00:47:12,059 --> 00:47:21,076
find that same clarity and precision

949
00:47:15,098 --> 00:47:20,176
that they that they turn hand and ricci

950
00:47:22,009 --> 00:47:26,087
have in their book so this is a this is

951
00:47:25,031 --> 00:47:28,064
a really good book I mean this is kind

952
00:47:26,087 --> 00:47:29,105
of book it's a reference but it's a kind

953
00:47:28,064 --> 00:47:31,067
of book you can just read from beginning

954
00:47:30,005 --> 00:47:33,016
to end and get a really good

955
00:47:31,094 --> 00:47:39,273
understanding of

956
00:47:33,016 --> 00:47:41,415
see there's a there's four main

957
00:47:40,119 --> 00:47:43,390
components to the course there's

958
00:47:41,559 --> 00:47:47,588
lectures where we go over the high-level

959
00:47:43,039 --> 00:47:51,124
concepts recitations where which meet

960
00:47:47,849 --> 00:47:54,460
once a week for an hour led by a TA and

961
00:47:52,024 --> 00:47:56,823
the purpose of the recitations is really

962
00:47:54,046 --> 00:47:59,118
to help you with the labs right so it's

963
00:47:57,039 --> 00:48:02,920
very practical and hands-on there's

964
00:48:00,018 --> 00:48:04,090
there's seven of those labs and these

965
00:48:02,092 --> 00:48:06,148
are really the heart and soul of the

966
00:48:04,009 --> 00:48:08,065
course this is where this is where all

967
00:48:07,048 --> 00:48:11,113
the real learning comes in I think when

968
00:48:09,046 --> 00:48:13,099
you actually have to do this stuff and

969
00:48:12,013 --> 00:48:16,089
that's why we take the cheating part so

970
00:48:13,099 --> 00:48:18,168
seriously because if you do these labs

971
00:48:16,089 --> 00:48:21,288
you're going to learn an incredible

972
00:48:19,059 --> 00:48:26,650
amount of really cool stuff if you don't

973
00:48:22,089 --> 00:48:29,170
do them you won't learn anything so each

974
00:48:26,065 --> 00:48:33,148
one of these these labs is one or two

975
00:48:29,017 --> 00:48:35,115
weeks each and involves typically some

976
00:48:34,048 --> 00:48:38,367
kind of programming or measurement

977
00:48:36,015 --> 00:48:43,023
there's also two exams a midterm and a

978
00:48:38,799 --> 00:48:49,960
final the the exams are proctored

979
00:48:43,095 --> 00:48:51,193
they're online proctored in Wien and and

980
00:48:49,096 --> 00:48:54,190
gates and what we do for the exams is we

981
00:48:52,093 --> 00:48:56,146
have like we take like four days from

982
00:48:55,009 --> 00:48:58,012
10:00 to 10:00 and then you can sign up

983
00:48:57,046 --> 00:49:01,048
and then we have like multiple clusters

984
00:48:59,002 --> 00:49:04,003
that are Network isolated and then you

985
00:49:01,066 --> 00:49:07,005
can sign up for a slot like a 6-hour

986
00:49:04,021 --> 00:49:08,160
slot and the midterm is like nominally

987
00:49:07,599 --> 00:49:10,599
like an hour

988
00:49:08,349 --> 00:49:12,760
eighty minute exam that's the same exam

989
00:49:10,599 --> 00:49:15,600
where you we gave when we used to have

990
00:49:12,076 --> 00:49:16,081
people sitting in person so it's

991
00:49:15,609 --> 00:49:20,140
nominally like 80 minutes but we give

992
00:49:17,026 --> 00:49:24,045
you like a five or six hour window to do

993
00:49:20,014 --> 00:49:26,050
it okay so there's so you can sign up

994
00:49:24,279 --> 00:49:28,305
any time any day that there's a slot

995
00:49:26,005 --> 00:49:30,114
okay so there's flexibilities that can

996
00:49:28,539 --> 00:49:32,980
kind of tailor it to your your schedule

997
00:49:30,609 --> 00:49:35,740
and we I think we've also removed all

998
00:49:32,098 --> 00:49:36,151
the time pressure right so which is you

999
00:49:35,074 --> 00:49:38,643
can you can go back you can check your

1000
00:49:37,051 --> 00:49:43,097
work you can you can just kind of relax

1001
00:49:39,309 --> 00:49:51,770
and not not not be worried about

1002
00:49:43,097 --> 00:49:53,236
how quickly you do it now there's many

1003
00:49:51,077 --> 00:49:54,916
different ways to get help the main

1004
00:49:54,109 --> 00:50:03,140
source of information is the course

1005
00:49:55,609 --> 00:50:05,810
webpage that's a WWF CMU edu Tildy 213

1006
00:50:03,014 --> 00:50:07,079
and all the information is there we've

1007
00:50:05,081 --> 00:50:09,164
got a complete schedule of lectures and

1008
00:50:07,079 --> 00:50:12,148
assignments we don't change it that it's

1009
00:50:10,064 --> 00:50:14,147
fixed it so you can look at that and and

1010
00:50:12,859 --> 00:50:17,930
plan your semester knowing that those

1011
00:50:15,047 --> 00:50:19,186
dates of won't change we've actually

1012
00:50:17,093 --> 00:50:22,154
even got all of the lectures posted

1013
00:50:19,609 --> 00:50:24,920
ahead of time for for the other

1014
00:50:23,054 --> 00:50:25,873
instructors around the world who are

1015
00:50:24,092 --> 00:50:31,094
using the book so we needed to get them

1016
00:50:26,359 --> 00:50:33,385
all already there's also news at at the

1017
00:50:31,094 --> 00:50:35,141
very beginning there's sort of news if

1018
00:50:33,619 --> 00:50:36,624
we need to make announcements we'll post

1019
00:50:36,041 --> 00:50:38,132
it there

1020
00:50:37,119 --> 00:50:45,640
we don't use either blackboard our

1021
00:50:39,032 --> 00:50:49,091
Piazza in the course instead we have a

1022
00:50:45,064 --> 00:50:51,098
staff mailing list that you can that you

1023
00:50:49,091 --> 00:50:53,126
can send mail to if you have questions

1024
00:50:51,098 --> 00:50:56,105
and all of the TAS and all of the

1025
00:50:54,026 --> 00:51:00,615
faculty are subscribed to that staff

1026
00:50:57,068 --> 00:51:03,007
mailing list and so we'll all see it and

1027
00:51:00,849 --> 00:51:05,960
we usually we try to have you know

1028
00:51:03,619 --> 00:51:09,640
really fast feedback right so there's so

1029
00:51:05,096 --> 00:51:11,485
many people so many people looking at

1030
00:51:09,064 --> 00:51:14,116
your emails that chance is very high

1031
00:51:12,349 --> 00:51:17,720
you'll get an answer back quickly the

1032
00:51:15,016 --> 00:51:19,028
disadvantage of having this advantage of

1033
00:51:17,072 --> 00:51:22,166
this mailing list is that it allows us

1034
00:51:19,028 --> 00:51:25,064
to control the message and control what

1035
00:51:23,066 --> 00:51:27,140
we're it's what feedback we're giving

1036
00:51:25,064 --> 00:51:29,153
back to you the disadvantage is that we

1037
00:51:28,004 --> 00:51:32,042
often get the same question over and

1038
00:51:30,053 --> 00:51:34,058
over again and so for that we've

1039
00:51:32,078 --> 00:51:36,089
established a FAQ if we find we're

1040
00:51:34,058 --> 00:51:39,080
getting same questions over and over

1041
00:51:36,089 --> 00:51:42,568
we've established a FAQ on the on the

1042
00:51:39,008 --> 00:51:45,100
course web page for sort of organized by

1043
00:51:43,369 --> 00:51:49,210
labs ok so you can you can see the

1044
00:51:46,072 --> 00:51:49,136
answers to frequently asked questions on

1045
00:51:49,021 --> 00:51:55,022
the

1046
00:51:50,036 --> 00:51:56,129
there we have office hours I think we're

1047
00:51:55,031 --> 00:51:59,114
still trying to eat we we're still

1048
00:51:57,029 --> 00:52:01,036
trying to meet with the staff and figure

1049
00:52:00,014 --> 00:52:03,023
out the exact office hours but what I'm

1050
00:52:01,099 --> 00:52:04,187
what we're thinking now is that we'll

1051
00:52:04,004 --> 00:52:09,028
have office hours so six days a week

1052
00:52:05,087 --> 00:52:11,096
okay every day that's Saturday

1053
00:52:09,028 --> 00:52:15,061
the they will be at the same time in

1054
00:52:11,096 --> 00:52:22,162
same place every day so from 5:45

1055
00:52:15,061 --> 00:52:27,116
to 8:30 in wean in a queen 5207 cluster

1056
00:52:23,062 --> 00:52:29,144
will have 213 TAS there to to help to

1057
00:52:28,016 --> 00:52:33,053
answer your questions okay so you don't

1058
00:52:30,044 --> 00:52:34,109
have to make appointments I mean you can

1059
00:52:33,053 --> 00:52:37,112
make an appointment to see any staff

1060
00:52:35,009 --> 00:52:39,068
member of course but you don't you you

1061
00:52:38,012 --> 00:52:41,033
know that at the same time same place

1062
00:52:39,068 --> 00:52:48,113
every day there's somebody you can go to

1063
00:52:41,033 --> 00:52:51,128
for help okay for our labs and exams

1064
00:52:49,013 --> 00:52:53,048
every assignment every lab is a single

1065
00:52:52,028 --> 00:52:56,042
person so we don't have any group

1066
00:52:53,048 --> 00:52:57,125
projects we want you to do the work

1067
00:52:56,042 --> 00:53:00,050
yourself now you know it's important to

1068
00:52:58,025 --> 00:53:03,083
work in groups and you will learn how to

1069
00:53:00,005 --> 00:53:05,054
work in groups and other classes see us

1070
00:53:03,083 --> 00:53:06,161
classes but not NC 13 we want this is a

1071
00:53:05,099 --> 00:53:10,136
kind of a core course we want you to

1072
00:53:07,061 --> 00:53:13,070
figure stuff out yourself all of our

1073
00:53:11,036 --> 00:53:15,077
hand ends will be due at 11:59 p.m. on

1074
00:53:13,007 --> 00:53:17,084
either a Tuesday or Thursday and this is

1075
00:53:15,077 --> 00:53:21,092
you can see which on the schedule page

1076
00:53:18,047 --> 00:53:27,074
on the course webpage and all of our

1077
00:53:21,092 --> 00:53:27,176
hand ins are using Auto lab where you

1078
00:53:27,074 --> 00:53:30,140
know you've probably used it for some of

1079
00:53:28,076 --> 00:53:32,129
your other classes but it's a it's a

1080
00:53:31,004 --> 00:53:35,057
Auto grading service that allows you to

1081
00:53:33,029 --> 00:53:37,031
get instant feedback on your on your on

1082
00:53:35,093 --> 00:53:40,154
your hand in so when you hand it in you

1083
00:53:37,031 --> 00:53:42,089
get feedback right away the exams like I

1084
00:53:41,054 --> 00:53:44,123
mentioned are going to be a network

1085
00:53:42,089 --> 00:53:47,134
isolated clusters held over multiple

1086
00:53:45,023 --> 00:53:51,074
days and and you can just sign up for a

1087
00:53:48,034 --> 00:53:54,046
slot that's available now what usually

1088
00:53:51,074 --> 00:53:55,151
happens is if we offer like the exam

1089
00:53:54,046 --> 00:53:59,137
Tuesday Wednesday and Thursday the

1090
00:53:56,051 --> 00:53:59,137
Thursday slot still up immediately

1091
00:54:00,005 --> 00:54:06,874
and so you know I guess I should try to

1092
00:54:05,042 --> 00:54:08,141
try to sign up soon if you want but

1093
00:54:07,369 --> 00:54:12,080
people always seem to want to defer to

1094
00:54:09,041 --> 00:54:15,050
the end rather than and this is me I'd

1095
00:54:12,008 --> 00:54:18,011
want to get it over with but so I just

1096
00:54:16,031 --> 00:54:20,102
thought that is sort of a constraint

1097
00:54:18,038 --> 00:54:25,117
right that if you can only sign up for

1098
00:54:21,002 --> 00:54:28,091
slots that that are available okay now

1099
00:54:26,017 --> 00:54:30,044
you know we make mistakes there's we

1100
00:54:28,091 --> 00:54:32,165
always make mistakes especially with

1101
00:54:30,044 --> 00:54:37,076
just so many students so we there's a

1102
00:54:33,065 --> 00:54:39,092
there's a specific process for appealing

1103
00:54:37,076 --> 00:54:42,077
grades if you think that there was a

1104
00:54:39,092 --> 00:54:45,098
that you're the work wasn't graded

1105
00:54:42,077 --> 00:54:48,104
properly so what you do after after

1106
00:54:45,098 --> 00:54:51,143
either an exam or after your labs are

1107
00:54:49,004 --> 00:54:56,009
graded you have 7 days to file an appeal

1108
00:54:52,043 --> 00:54:58,732
and appeals have to be in in writing and

1109
00:54:56,009 --> 00:55:01,058
hardcopy okay so there's no we won't we

1110
00:54:59,119 --> 00:55:04,430
won't we won't consider any email any

1111
00:55:01,058 --> 00:55:06,577
appeals via email it has to be in

1112
00:55:04,043 --> 00:55:08,117
writing and hardcopy and you give those

1113
00:55:07,099 --> 00:55:13,250
to me and if I'm not there you can just

1114
00:55:09,017 --> 00:55:14,099
slide it under the desk ok and what the

1115
00:55:13,025 --> 00:55:19,144
reason we do it that way is it allows us

1116
00:55:14,099 --> 00:55:21,173
to treat everybody fairly so we get all

1117
00:55:19,369 --> 00:55:24,680
the appeals together at once and then we

1118
00:55:22,073 --> 00:55:26,117
can we can we can treat everybody the

1119
00:55:24,068 --> 00:55:30,115
same way rather than just sort of doing

1120
00:55:27,017 --> 00:55:30,115
them one at a time like that ok

1121
00:55:33,039 --> 00:55:40,087
now for our labs we have ten machines

1122
00:55:37,849 --> 00:55:42,898
that were donated by Intel called the

1123
00:55:40,519 --> 00:55:47,900
shark machines so initially our first

1124
00:55:43,339 --> 00:55:50,630
version of t 13 and I guess we started

1125
00:55:47,009 --> 00:55:53,668
using Intel machines in 1999 we used to

1126
00:55:50,063 --> 00:55:57,071
alpha processors for the first year I

1127
00:55:54,559 --> 00:55:59,180
like to fish so all of our machines were

1128
00:55:57,071 --> 00:56:01,960
they were called the fish machines right

1129
00:55:59,018 --> 00:56:04,046
they were freshwater fish and then we

1130
00:56:02,599 --> 00:56:06,380
upgraded a few years after that and

1131
00:56:04,046 --> 00:56:10,435
those were the saltwater fish machines

1132
00:56:06,038 --> 00:56:13,687
and then we upgraded like in 2011 to

1133
00:56:10,849 --> 00:56:16,160
these Nehalem class servers and run out

1134
00:56:14,029 --> 00:56:19,940
of fresh water fish and saltwater fish

1135
00:56:16,016 --> 00:56:22,165
so the next grade up was sharks right so

1136
00:56:19,094 --> 00:56:24,403
every fish is it's named after some kind

1137
00:56:22,309 --> 00:56:28,640
of shark but these are the same machines

1138
00:56:25,249 --> 00:56:29,660
that that you'll that auto lab uses for

1139
00:56:28,064 --> 00:56:32,953
grading right so there's some

1140
00:56:29,066 --> 00:56:36,122
consistency for performance-oriented

1141
00:56:33,529 --> 00:56:39,610
labs like malloc lab and you can access

1142
00:56:37,022 --> 00:56:42,151
them that they're you the names are

1143
00:56:40,339 --> 00:56:45,410
listed on the course webpage and so you

1144
00:56:42,349 --> 00:56:47,210
can SSH to a specific machine they're

1145
00:56:45,041 --> 00:56:48,250
all identical if you have an Andrew

1146
00:56:47,021 --> 00:56:49,600
account you've already got accounts on

1147
00:56:48,619 --> 00:56:52,636
the machines right so there's nothing

1148
00:56:49,789 --> 00:56:54,680
special to do or you can just SSH to

1149
00:56:52,789 --> 00:56:58,794
sharp got ICS and it'll just randomly

1150
00:56:54,068 --> 00:57:01,717
put you on on one of the shark machines

1151
00:56:58,839 --> 00:57:04,840
okay if if you have any trouble logging

1152
00:57:02,329 --> 00:57:10,700
in just send send mail to the staff

1153
00:57:04,849 --> 00:57:14,450
mailing list okay we know that during

1154
00:57:10,007 --> 00:57:18,666
the semester things come up grandparents

1155
00:57:14,045 --> 00:57:18,954
died especially near the near the final

1156
00:57:22,008 --> 00:57:27,057
that's harsh I know but that things come

1157
00:57:25,095 --> 00:57:28,182
up right and you've got your very busy

1158
00:57:27,057 --> 00:57:31,062
you're taking a lot of courses so

1159
00:57:29,082 --> 00:57:33,171
instead of sort of dealing with requests

1160
00:57:32,007 --> 00:57:37,050
for extensions and you know all these

1161
00:57:34,071 --> 00:57:40,152
special cases what we do is we give you

1162
00:57:37,005 --> 00:57:44,103
five Grace days that you can then spend

1163
00:57:41,052 --> 00:57:48,066
as you wish so if you hand your work in

1164
00:57:45,048 --> 00:57:51,051
late one day late you'll automatically

1165
00:57:48,066 --> 00:57:53,067
consume a great day okay we don't allow

1166
00:57:51,078 --> 00:57:55,116
you to sort of allocate the grace days

1167
00:57:53,076 --> 00:57:58,104
you spend one of your grades days by

1168
00:57:56,016 --> 00:58:00,063
handing in late so if you have a great

1169
00:57:59,004 --> 00:58:02,079
day less than you hand in late

1170
00:58:00,063 --> 00:58:04,064
you'll spend that great day but you

1171
00:58:02,079 --> 00:58:07,143
won't be penalized for the late hand in

1172
00:58:04,064 --> 00:58:13,122
and so we have five great days over the

1173
00:58:08,043 --> 00:58:17,046
entire semester and a maximum of two

1174
00:58:14,022 --> 00:58:19,041
great days for the assignments now we're

1175
00:58:17,046 --> 00:58:21,072
going to set up since the first three

1176
00:58:19,041 --> 00:58:24,087
assignments are kind of not as

1177
00:58:21,072 --> 00:58:26,133
programming intensive and don't take as

1178
00:58:24,087 --> 00:58:29,151
much time we're not going to allow any

1179
00:58:27,033 --> 00:58:33,078
great days for those because a one grace

1180
00:58:30,051 --> 00:58:36,060
day one sorry one great day and then for

1181
00:58:33,078 --> 00:58:37,095
the the latter four labs which are much

1182
00:58:36,006 --> 00:58:40,032
more intense we're going to allow you to

1183
00:58:37,095 --> 00:58:42,120
a max of two great states and the reason

1184
00:58:40,086 --> 00:58:43,170
we're doing this is because we don't

1185
00:58:43,002 --> 00:58:47,004
want you to burn you're good these great

1186
00:58:44,007 --> 00:58:48,009
days are valuable they're critical

1187
00:58:47,004 --> 00:58:54,036
especially later in the semester when

1188
00:58:48,009 --> 00:58:55,032
have you really really dizzy so we don't

1189
00:58:54,072 --> 00:58:57,120
want you to burn off your grace days

1190
00:58:56,013 --> 00:59:00,069
early in the semester and this happens

1191
00:58:58,002 --> 00:59:02,007
every semester and it's and then when

1192
00:59:00,069 --> 00:59:04,137
alec lab comes up there's no gray space

1193
00:59:02,007 --> 00:59:07,074
left and it's really it's really sad to

1194
00:59:05,037 --> 00:59:11,058
see that and so we're going to limit you

1195
00:59:08,037 --> 00:59:17,079
to one for those first three just to

1196
00:59:11,058 --> 00:59:22,092
help you save you from yourself now

1197
00:59:17,079 --> 00:59:23,148
it the the the nominal late penalty if

1198
00:59:22,092 --> 00:59:28,137
you don't have a great days fifteen

1199
00:59:24,048 --> 00:59:31,059
percent per day and we don't allow any

1200
00:59:29,037 --> 00:59:33,039
hand in three days after the due date at

1201
00:59:31,059 --> 00:59:37,152
all so that Auto live shuts off the min

1202
00:59:33,057 --> 00:59:40,110
and then that's it now if there's some

1203
00:59:38,052 --> 00:59:43,107
kind of catastrophic event you know then

1204
00:59:41,001 --> 00:59:46,059
you know please contact us for an

1205
00:59:44,007 --> 00:59:48,051
extension right so we're not you know we

1206
00:59:46,068 --> 00:59:52,080
try to be reasonable but most of the

1207
00:59:48,051 --> 00:59:53,148
most of the most of the reasons that for

1208
00:59:52,008 --> 00:59:59,106
requesting extensions you can handle

1209
00:59:54,048 --> 01:00:03,060
yourself using your grades days and just

1210
01:00:00,078 --> 01:00:07,116
I mean this is that this is advice that

1211
01:00:03,006 --> 01:00:10,029
give every semester to but I but it's

1212
01:00:08,016 --> 01:00:14,025
people often don't don't pay attention

1213
01:00:10,083 --> 01:00:16,092
but or just they're unable to but but

1214
01:00:15,006 --> 01:00:19,011
really for every one of these

1215
01:00:16,092 --> 01:00:20,154
assignments you want to start early and

1216
01:00:19,056 --> 01:00:24,062
the reason is you need to give yourself

1217
01:00:21,054 --> 01:00:26,115
time to to go seek help if you get stuck

1218
01:00:24,062 --> 01:00:28,089
because the nature of these very

1219
01:00:27,015 --> 01:00:30,051
programming intensive assignments like

1220
01:00:28,089 --> 01:00:32,142
we have in 213 is that you're going to

1221
01:00:30,051 --> 01:00:35,100
get stuck and and often it's very hard

1222
01:00:33,042 --> 01:00:38,064
to to bound the time you spend on on

1223
01:00:36,000 --> 01:00:40,011
some of these assignments you know it's

1224
01:00:38,064 --> 01:00:40,133
not like problem sets where you can kind

1225
01:00:40,011 --> 01:00:43,068
of predict you know this will take

1226
01:00:41,033 --> 01:00:46,059
there's no taking like three hours to do

1227
01:00:43,068 --> 01:00:48,126
these problem sets for a lot of the 213

1228
01:00:46,059 --> 01:00:50,082
assignments it's very difficult to to

1229
01:00:49,026 --> 01:00:52,071
sort of manage your time and bound your

1230
01:00:50,082 --> 01:00:53,175
time so for that reason you really want

1231
01:00:52,071 --> 01:00:58,107
to start early to give yourself a chance

1232
01:00:54,075 --> 01:01:01,143
to get help when you get stuck now in

1233
01:00:59,007 --> 01:01:08,105
the lecture hall of you're permitted to

1234
01:01:02,043 --> 01:01:11,109
have your laptop but we ask you not to

1235
01:01:09,005 --> 01:01:13,083
send email or instant messaging or cell

1236
01:01:12,009 --> 01:01:16,020
phone texting or anything like that if

1237
01:01:13,083 --> 01:01:19,156
you here we want you to to be attentive

1238
01:01:16,002 --> 01:01:22,009
and engaged the

1239
01:01:20,056 --> 01:01:24,115
your presence in lectures and

1240
01:01:22,009 --> 01:01:26,080
recitations is voluntary so we don't

1241
01:01:25,015 --> 01:01:30,031
take we don't take role at either of

1242
01:01:27,061 --> 01:01:32,158
those we encourage you to come but it's

1243
01:01:30,031 --> 01:01:37,053
not required and no recordings of any

1244
01:01:33,058 --> 01:01:36,153
kind except this one

1245
01:01:38,061 --> 01:01:45,118
okay the exams and labs are weighted

1246
01:01:41,029 --> 01:01:48,061
equally 50% midterms 20 finals 30 and

1247
01:01:46,018 --> 01:01:53,092
final grades are based on a straight 90

1248
01:01:48,061 --> 01:01:58,068
80 70 scale now rough outline of the

1249
01:01:53,092 --> 01:02:00,133
semester the first three labs cover

1250
01:01:59,031 --> 01:02:03,114
programs reference the Machine

1251
01:02:01,033 --> 01:02:06,079
representations of programs and data

1252
01:02:04,014 --> 01:02:09,043
data lab is how we teach you about fit

1253
01:02:06,079 --> 01:02:11,176
level representations of data so you'll

1254
01:02:09,043 --> 01:02:15,117
sell collection of puzzles and see like

1255
01:02:12,076 --> 01:02:17,125
a puzzle might be is a little function

1256
01:02:16,017 --> 01:02:20,032
that you have to implement and like

1257
01:02:18,025 --> 01:02:22,039
absolute value so a function that

1258
01:02:20,032 --> 01:02:25,081
returns the absolute value of its art

1259
01:02:22,039 --> 01:02:27,040
input argument the kicker is that we

1260
01:02:25,081 --> 01:02:28,084
restrict the set of operators that you

1261
01:02:27,049 --> 01:02:32,050
can use and it has to be straight line

1262
01:02:29,011 --> 01:02:34,069
code no conditionals or loops and so to

1263
01:02:32,005 --> 01:02:35,011
solve these puzzles so imagine how you

1264
01:02:34,069 --> 01:02:37,144
might try to solve absolute value

1265
01:02:36,001 --> 01:02:40,057
without using an if statement right the

1266
01:02:38,044 --> 01:02:46,050
normal way to do it would be if X less

1267
01:02:40,066 --> 01:02:45,150
than zero return x or negative x

1268
01:02:46,053 --> 01:02:52,087
see I told you we make mistakes but

1269
01:02:51,004 --> 01:02:54,091
imagine how you might do that without

1270
01:02:52,087 --> 01:02:56,173
using conditionals and only using bit

1271
01:02:54,091 --> 01:02:59,158
level C operations right so this is how

1272
01:02:57,073 --> 01:03:04,102
this is how this is our way of teaching

1273
01:03:00,058 --> 01:03:06,142
you how data is really represented in

1274
01:03:05,002 --> 01:03:10,039
the machine now the bomb lab which

1275
01:03:07,042 --> 01:03:12,046
you've probably heard at this is this is

1276
01:03:10,039 --> 01:03:17,050
a kind of famous all over the world now

1277
01:03:12,082 --> 01:03:19,135
and at CMU the bomb lab is the way we

1278
01:03:17,005 --> 01:03:23,104
teach you how to read and understand

1279
01:03:20,035 --> 01:03:27,112
assembly language and a bomb just

1280
01:03:24,049 --> 01:03:30,103
briefly a bomb is a is a C program that

1281
01:03:28,012 --> 01:03:33,103
consists of a collection of six phases

1282
01:03:31,003 --> 01:03:37,015
and each phase wants you to type

1283
01:03:34,003 --> 01:03:40,054
something in at the keyboard if you type

1284
01:03:37,015 --> 01:03:43,021
in the what it wants you to type what it

1285
01:03:40,054 --> 01:03:45,136
expects you to type then you've diffused

1286
01:03:43,075 --> 01:03:47,110
that phase and it goes to the next phase

1287
01:03:46,036 --> 01:03:50,110
then you have to type with that phase

1288
01:03:48,001 --> 01:03:54,043
once and if you defuse all the phases

1289
01:03:51,001 --> 01:03:56,086
then you've diffused the bomb however if

1290
01:03:54,052 --> 01:04:00,070
you type in the wrong thing then the

1291
01:03:56,095 --> 01:04:02,113
bomb explodes by printing boom and you

1292
01:04:00,007 --> 01:04:04,075
have to try it again and the kicker is

1293
01:04:03,013 --> 01:04:10,069
in either case when if you explode the

1294
01:04:05,038 --> 01:04:14,056
bomb or defuse a phase that information

1295
01:04:10,069 --> 01:04:15,157
gets sent to auto lab if you and we use

1296
01:04:14,056 --> 01:04:19,075
the defusing string that that your bomb

1297
01:04:16,057 --> 01:04:21,112
sends us and we check it out on a copy

1298
01:04:19,075 --> 01:04:23,164
of your bomb that we keep on the server

1299
01:04:22,012 --> 01:04:27,013
that's another thing every everybody

1300
01:04:24,064 --> 01:04:32,101
gets a different bomb slightly different

1301
01:04:27,022 --> 01:04:34,099
bomb so we check so when you defuse when

1302
01:04:33,001 --> 01:04:37,042
you just use the phase Auto lab takes

1303
01:04:34,099 --> 01:04:38,131
the string that it that your bomb sends

1304
01:04:37,042 --> 01:04:42,118
us and then compares against the local

1305
01:04:39,031 --> 01:04:46,033
copy of your bomb if you explode phase

1306
01:04:43,018 --> 01:04:48,019
you lose half a point so there's a real

1307
01:04:46,051 --> 01:04:50,115
consequence to exploding a bomb it's

1308
01:04:48,019 --> 01:04:50,115
very very tense

1309
01:04:52,369 --> 01:04:58,560
until you learn how to use GDB to set a

1310
01:04:55,056 --> 01:05:01,113
breakpoint before the function that

1311
01:04:58,056 --> 01:05:04,095
sends the information to the server and

1312
01:05:02,013 --> 01:05:07,047
we want you to do that right so a bombs

1313
01:05:04,095 --> 01:05:07,101
are really the bombs really beautiful

1314
01:05:07,047 --> 01:05:13,426
it's kind of fun it's kind of like a

1315
01:05:08,055 --> 01:05:18,374
video game it it teaches you how to read

1316
01:05:13,849 --> 01:05:21,240
compiler generated code because the only

1317
01:05:18,869 --> 01:05:21,941
oh the kicker is sorry the kicker is we

1318
01:05:21,024 --> 01:05:25,133
don't give you the source code all we

1319
01:05:22,589 --> 01:05:28,290
give you is the binary hence the binary

1320
01:05:25,349 --> 01:05:31,380
bomb so in order to defuse a bomb you've

1321
01:05:28,029 --> 01:05:32,103
got to fire up gdb single trace through

1322
01:05:31,038 --> 01:05:35,051
the find where the code is for each

1323
01:05:33,003 --> 01:05:37,098
phase single trace through that code and

1324
01:05:35,051 --> 01:05:40,128
sort of reverse engineer and figure out

1325
01:05:37,098 --> 01:05:42,126
what it wants you to type in and then

1326
01:05:41,028 --> 01:05:45,045
you'll quickly find out where that

1327
01:05:43,026 --> 01:05:48,635
function that explodes the bomb is and

1328
01:05:45,045 --> 01:05:51,057
you'll put a breakpoint there and so we

1329
01:05:48,869 --> 01:05:53,580
want you to do that because the bomb

1330
01:05:51,057 --> 01:05:55,089
besides teaching you how to program

1331
01:05:53,058 --> 01:05:57,063
assembly language it also teaches you

1332
01:05:55,089 --> 01:05:58,095
sort of organically how to use gdb

1333
01:05:57,063 --> 01:06:03,144
because you really can't do it if you

1334
01:05:59,049 --> 01:06:06,120
don't use if you don't run gdb and then

1335
01:06:04,044 --> 01:06:09,108
the the third lab is this is a new lab

1336
01:06:07,002 --> 01:06:13,074
the semester the Randy's developed

1337
01:06:10,008 --> 01:06:16,032
called the attack lab and we developed

1338
01:06:13,092 --> 01:06:17,127
this lab specifically for 64-bit

1339
01:06:16,032 --> 01:06:22,032
architecture so this is a reflection of

1340
01:06:18,027 --> 01:06:24,030
the change from 32 bits to 64 bits and

1341
01:06:22,032 --> 01:06:27,039
this is really excited about this one

1342
01:06:24,057 --> 01:06:32,133
you'll learn how to you'll learn how to

1343
01:06:28,002 --> 01:06:35,028
write exploits using return to a sort of

1344
01:06:33,033 --> 01:06:37,047
a modern technique called return to

1345
01:06:35,028 --> 01:06:39,063
return oriented programming which is

1346
01:06:37,047 --> 01:06:41,055
kind of the modern modern way that

1347
01:06:39,063 --> 01:06:47,115
hackers deal with the fact that stacks

1348
01:06:41,055 --> 01:06:51,126
in newer machines move around and and

1349
01:06:48,015 --> 01:06:54,704
are prohibitive and make an impossible

1350
01:06:52,026 --> 01:06:56,375
to execute code on the on the stack so

1351
01:06:54,839 --> 01:06:58,770
this the brand new labs really I think

1352
01:06:56,609 --> 01:07:01,040
it's really going to be really going to

1353
01:06:58,077 --> 01:07:00,104
be neat

1354
01:07:01,759 --> 01:07:05,794
in the memory hierarchy when we study

1355
01:07:04,013 --> 01:07:08,992
the memory hierarchy we we have a cash

1356
01:07:06,109 --> 01:07:10,198
lab called the cash lab where you'll

1357
01:07:09,109 --> 01:07:14,650
build your own cash simulator so this is

1358
01:07:10,999 --> 01:07:16,970
how you sort of learn how this hardware

1359
01:07:14,065 --> 01:07:18,122
that Randy was mentioning called it

1360
01:07:16,097 --> 01:07:20,168
cache memory works you'll build a

1361
01:07:19,022 --> 01:07:24,051
simulator and see for that and then

1362
01:07:21,068 --> 01:07:26,377
you'll take a small transpose function

1363
01:07:24,249 --> 01:07:29,278
and you'll try to make that that code

1364
01:07:26,989 --> 01:07:31,996
run with as few misses as possible on

1365
01:07:29,539 --> 01:07:34,430
your simulator and this will involve

1366
01:07:32,059 --> 01:07:38,133
sort of understanding of how the memory

1367
01:07:34,043 --> 01:07:38,412
hierarchy works and how to exploit it

1368
01:07:40,569 --> 01:07:46,390
the part of the course where you we sort

1369
01:07:43,097 --> 01:07:48,616
of transitioned from hardware to

1370
01:07:46,039 --> 01:07:52,498
interacting with the the system software

1371
01:07:49,489 --> 01:07:55,570
that the operating system there's sort

1372
01:07:52,849 --> 01:07:59,960
of a concept that we call exceptional

1373
01:07:56,299 --> 01:08:02,320
control flaws that exists in all parts

1374
01:07:59,096 --> 01:08:04,115
of the system and it sort of represents

1375
01:08:02,509 --> 01:08:09,541
that intellectual transition from

1376
01:08:05,015 --> 01:08:11,644
hardware to software so this is how this

1377
01:08:09,829 --> 01:08:14,450
was sort of a key idea that allowed us

1378
01:08:11,779 --> 01:08:17,000
to kind of smoothly move from from

1379
01:08:14,045 --> 01:08:19,624
hardware to software in some

1380
01:08:17,000 --> 01:08:22,004
intellectually consistent way and so the

1381
01:08:20,029 --> 01:08:24,046
the ideas that you cover an exceptional

1382
01:08:22,004 --> 01:08:26,048
control floor like low hard low-level

1383
01:08:24,199 --> 01:08:29,270
hardware interrupts and exceptions and

1384
01:08:26,048 --> 01:08:30,457
then at the higher level sort of

1385
01:08:29,027 --> 01:08:33,050
involving hardware and operating system

1386
01:08:30,889 --> 01:08:36,560
software is the idea of an opera of the

1387
01:08:33,005 --> 01:08:38,164
process context switch ok so this is

1388
01:08:36,056 --> 01:08:41,150
this is where you start to learn what

1389
01:08:38,659 --> 01:08:44,752
processes are and how to how to ask the

1390
01:08:42,005 --> 01:08:47,059
kernel to create in manage processes for

1391
01:08:45,589 --> 01:08:49,597
you at the next higher level or a

1392
01:08:48,004 --> 01:08:52,100
software form of exceptional control

1393
01:08:50,389 --> 01:08:55,411
flow called a signal so this exists

1394
01:08:53,000 --> 01:08:58,909
solely on the Linux kernel and then and

1395
01:08:55,609 --> 01:09:00,685
then even at a higher level at there's

1396
01:08:58,909 --> 01:09:03,004
an application C language version of

1397
01:09:01,369 --> 01:09:06,466
exceptional control flow call set jump

1398
01:09:03,859 --> 01:09:08,887
and long jump so this this notion of

1399
01:09:07,339 --> 01:09:10,408
exceptional control flow kind of exists

1400
01:09:09,139 --> 01:09:12,161
in all parts of the system we covered

1401
01:09:11,029 --> 01:09:16,115
all at once

1402
01:09:12,359 --> 01:09:20,460
and the lab that we use to sort of

1403
01:09:16,889 --> 01:09:21,974
exercise all these ideas is called the

1404
01:09:20,046 --> 01:09:24,123
shell lab and in the shell lab you'll

1405
01:09:22,739 --> 01:09:26,771
write your own linux shell which is

1406
01:09:25,023 --> 01:09:28,592
really cool so that's the program the

1407
01:09:27,059 --> 01:09:31,102
command line program that you interact

1408
01:09:28,799 --> 01:09:36,270
with whenever you log into a Linux box

1409
01:09:31,489 --> 01:09:37,230
you're going to write your own and I

1410
01:09:36,027 --> 01:09:39,054
don't look for me that was really

1411
01:09:37,023 --> 01:09:40,952
exciting when I could like write

1412
01:09:39,054 --> 01:09:46,125
something that looked like a real shell

1413
01:09:41,159 --> 01:09:50,240
it was pretty neat the next area is well

1414
01:09:47,025 --> 01:09:52,934
study is called virtual memory virtual

1415
01:09:50,969 --> 01:09:55,920
memory is a sort of combination of

1416
01:09:53,159 --> 01:09:58,650
hardware and software that presents an

1417
01:09:55,092 --> 01:10:01,351
abstraction to you of this variant of

1418
01:09:58,065 --> 01:10:04,136
memory is a very large array of bytes

1419
01:10:02,179 --> 01:10:08,204
when in reality memory is a hierarchy of

1420
01:10:05,036 --> 01:10:11,055
hardware and of cache memories and D

1421
01:10:08,429 --> 01:10:13,800
Rams virtual memory provides a very

1422
01:10:11,055 --> 01:10:15,974
high-level abstraction and as just a

1423
01:10:13,008 --> 01:10:18,407
linear sequence of bytes it also does

1424
01:10:16,469 --> 01:10:21,150
provide a lot of a lot of other useful

1425
01:10:19,199 --> 01:10:23,460
abstractions that make many different

1426
01:10:21,015 --> 01:10:23,714
parts of the system much easier to

1427
01:10:23,046 --> 01:10:26,055
manage

1428
01:10:23,849 --> 01:10:30,420
ok so we'll learn we learn about virtual

1429
01:10:26,055 --> 01:10:31,140
memory we'll learn how it works we'll

1430
01:10:30,042 --> 01:10:33,129
learn about the performance impact

1431
01:10:32,004 --> 01:10:37,163
potential performance impact that it has

1432
01:10:34,029 --> 01:10:39,938
on your programs and and we'll also

1433
01:10:37,559 --> 01:10:41,648
learn how to manage that large pool of

1434
01:10:40,199 --> 01:10:45,260
memory that it makes available to you

1435
01:10:42,449 --> 01:10:46,541
and the lab that we do that the lab

1436
01:10:45,809 --> 01:10:49,811
where you'll do that is called malloc

1437
01:10:47,369 --> 01:10:53,760
lab and in the malloc lab you'll write

1438
01:10:49,829 --> 01:10:55,800
your own malloc and free functions ok so

1439
01:10:53,076 --> 01:10:58,685
you'll you'll reinvent the functionality

1440
01:10:55,008 --> 01:11:04,517
of the Lib C malloc and free and this is

1441
01:10:59,369 --> 01:11:07,442
a maybe a minute maybe it's two pages of

1442
01:11:05,309 --> 01:11:12,300
code but it'll be a guarantee it'll be

1443
01:11:08,099 --> 01:11:15,780
the most sophisticated difficult two

1444
01:11:12,003 --> 01:11:17,672
pages of code you've written not only

1445
01:11:15,078 --> 01:11:20,417
because since it's managing the memory

1446
01:11:17,969 --> 01:11:23,520
system you can't use all of I mean C

1447
01:11:21,119 --> 01:11:25,127
doesn't have many C doesn't help you out

1448
01:11:23,052 --> 01:11:28,065
a lot

1449
01:11:25,199 --> 01:11:30,251
with extractions for data structures but

1450
01:11:28,065 --> 01:11:33,102
when you're writing but at least it does

1451
01:11:30,719 --> 01:11:35,765
give you ideas like strux unions that

1452
01:11:34,002 --> 01:11:38,201
you can use to structure your memory

1453
01:11:36,179 --> 01:11:40,225
when you're writing a malloc package you

1454
01:11:38,219 --> 01:11:43,130
can't use any of those you have to ride

1455
01:11:40,639 --> 01:11:45,716
exclusively on pointers and casting

1456
01:11:43,013 --> 01:11:50,019
because you malloc tax is working at

1457
01:11:46,409 --> 01:11:53,453
such a low level and so it's a very very

1458
01:11:50,019 --> 01:11:55,718
difficult piece of code for that reason

1459
01:11:53,849 --> 01:11:57,938
but also the design space for malloc is

1460
01:11:55,889 --> 01:12:00,750
is enormous you have many options

1461
01:11:58,739 --> 01:12:03,900
they all have implications that

1462
01:12:00,075 --> 01:12:08,774
trade-off performance and a memory

1463
01:12:03,009 --> 01:12:13,046
efficiency and finally in the last part

1464
01:12:09,449 --> 01:12:16,980
of the course we deal with i/o

1465
01:12:14,027 --> 01:12:18,054
input/output so so far in the course

1466
01:12:16,098 --> 01:12:20,181
we've just talked about sort of running

1467
01:12:18,054 --> 01:12:23,067
programs on machines in the last part of

1468
01:12:21,081 --> 01:12:26,390
the course we'll talk about input and

1469
01:12:23,067 --> 01:12:29,516
output sending data into and out of the

1470
01:12:27,119 --> 01:12:35,156
machine so we'll look at basic concepts

1471
01:12:30,119 --> 01:12:37,290
of Linux i/o will and since I think the

1472
01:12:35,489 --> 01:12:39,360
most interesting form of i/o is is

1473
01:12:37,029 --> 01:12:41,708
networking which allows you to talk to

1474
01:12:39,036 --> 01:12:44,079
machines anywhere in the world

1475
01:12:41,969 --> 01:12:46,170
using the internet we'll also talk we'll

1476
01:12:44,079 --> 01:12:48,178
learn how to do network programming

1477
01:12:46,017 --> 01:12:53,034
you'll learn how to write programs that

1478
01:12:48,889 --> 01:12:56,040
use the sockets interface which is the

1479
01:12:53,034 --> 01:12:57,623
basic interface for the Internet to talk

1480
01:12:56,004 --> 01:13:00,081
to machines any potentially any machine

1481
01:12:57,929 --> 01:13:03,090
in the in the world and that's really

1482
01:13:00,081 --> 01:13:04,140
exciting I mean once I can still

1483
01:13:03,009 --> 01:13:07,808
remember when developing this course I

1484
01:13:05,004 --> 01:13:09,102
had two windows open on my machine

1485
01:13:07,889 --> 01:13:12,570
I was SSH into two different machines

1486
01:13:10,038 --> 01:13:14,100
and I wrote a program to send a message

1487
01:13:12,057 --> 01:13:16,152
like hello world from one machine to the

1488
01:13:15,000 --> 01:13:20,219
other and when that hello world appeared

1489
01:13:17,052 --> 01:13:21,123
on the second windows like so exciting I

1490
01:13:20,219 --> 01:13:25,010
mean if you're a nerd it's really

1491
01:13:22,023 --> 01:13:27,108
exciting but

1492
01:13:25,001 --> 01:13:30,066
but just the thought that that could

1493
01:13:28,008 --> 01:13:31,101
have been at any machine right that

1494
01:13:30,066 --> 01:13:35,114
could have been any machine that does

1495
01:13:32,001 --> 01:13:36,014
just like opens up a whole new world

1496
01:13:39,014 --> 01:13:45,018
okay all of our all of our hands are

1497
01:13:43,011 --> 01:13:49,032
using a system called Auto lab which was

1498
01:13:45,054 --> 01:13:51,132
developed here and you can access it if

1499
01:13:49,032 --> 01:13:54,096
you if you are on the roster as of this

1500
01:13:52,032 --> 01:13:57,054
morning if you go to the Auto lab link

1501
01:13:54,096 --> 01:14:00,105
then you'll see this course was based on

1502
01:13:57,054 --> 01:14:03,105
your page if you're not enrolled you

1503
01:14:01,005 --> 01:14:05,010
won't have an auto lab account and you

1504
01:14:04,005 --> 01:14:08,924
have to be enrolled to get an auto lab

1505
01:14:05,055 --> 01:14:10,131
account so if you if you want to try to

1506
01:14:08,969 --> 01:14:13,067
wait it out and wait for people to drop

1507
01:14:11,031 --> 01:14:15,078
I'll make the first couple of elite the

1508
01:14:13,949 --> 01:14:17,730
first assignment due available from the

1509
01:14:15,078 --> 01:14:19,125
course web page so you can work on it

1510
01:14:17,073 --> 01:14:27,087
without actually handing into Auto lab

1511
01:14:20,025 --> 01:14:29,031
but at least you can keep going okay if

1512
01:14:27,087 --> 01:14:30,132
you enroll actually I didn't update this

1513
01:14:29,031 --> 01:14:35,034
but I updated the Auto lab accounts

1514
01:14:31,032 --> 01:14:39,057
today now one final thing if you have

1515
01:14:35,061 --> 01:14:41,067
waitlist questions please don't don't

1516
01:14:39,057 --> 01:14:45,066
send email to the staff because we don't

1517
01:14:41,067 --> 01:14:47,163
control the waiver so you should contact

1518
01:14:45,066 --> 01:14:51,161
one of these either Cathy Catherine or

1519
01:14:48,063 --> 01:14:54,110
Zahra depending on which class you had

1520
01:14:52,061 --> 01:14:56,154
okay so that's that welcome again

1521
01:14:55,001 --> 01:15:00,098
looking forward to a great semester and

1522
01:14:57,054 --> 01:15:00,107
we'll see you on Thursday
